Covering north France, the Normandy Tribunal is the most populous and most stereotypically feudal Tribunal in the Order. It is the seat of power for House Tytalus, and bears some of the deepest scars of the Schism War. Ruins of old House Diedne are not entirely uncommon, but the past has long been swept behind the Order. The Order deals with numerous lords, towns, cities, and a complex shortage of Vis within this Tribunal.
## Why would you want to play in the Normandy Tribunal?
- You want to play out knightly romances and chivalry in the style of Arthur and Charlemagne.
- You want to have a populous mundane world surrounding your Covenant.
- You want to deal with the greatest scars left from the Schism War and remnants of House Diedne.
- You want to deal with a more militant Order, a place where skirmishes between Covenants is more common.
## Vis Level
Low
Though there are a number of supernatural locations, beings, and goings on all throughout north France, thanks to the incredibly dense population and the spread of the Dominion, Vis remains scarce. Rulings have been passed in the Tribunal to regulate this large scale shortage of Vis.
## State of Hermetic Politics
For the most part, this Tribunal is currently stable, but the great lieges of the Tribunal ever jockey for power between them. It is also hard to look away at the situation at the Domus Magna of House Tytalus, with the dueling leaders of the House attempting to overcome each other.
There are quiet rumblings from some Covenants that wish to split off from the Tribunal and form a new one with some Covenants from the Rhine. Clearly House Tytalus would never get involved themselves to complicate this plot.

## State of Mundane Politics
After the deposition of King John in England in 1216, things have mostly been at peace. Currently young Henry III is on the English throne, and is eyeing taking back English possessions in the south west of France, though he is still young. Louis VIII is currently perpetuating the Albigensian Crusade to the south in Toulouse and southern France.
## New Covenant Setup Requirements
Technically, setting up a new Covenant in Normandy is very simple. The Covenant must have exclusive access to a Vis source or sources that give a total of at least one Vis per magi, or 4 Vis, whichever is greater, per year. This source or sources must be no more than a day’s journey from the Covenant council chamber without the use of magic. However, due to the limit of Vis in the area, most are taken, or at least in use as a legacy (explained below) by another Covenant. These rules are called the Perthean Compact.
Thus, new Covenants are likely to come into existence by a liege Covenant giving up some of its access to its legacy Vis sources to form a Covenant in the area. The vassal Covenant swears an oath of fealty to its liege, and is established. The exact details vary, but there’s usually a small tax of Vis, perhaps the requirement the vassal vote a certain way, or more direct assistance.
## Hermetic Culture
- As mentioned above, there are numerous types of Vis source ownership in the Tribunal that was determined in the Perthean Compac
	- Seisins - Any Vis source within a day’s return march of an established Covenant belongs to that Covenant automatically. Such a source is called a Seisin. Only the Covenant has the right to harvest it.
	- Though this distance cannot be determined via magic traveling, that doesn’t mean Covenants don’t try to cheese it. There is a special type of grog called a Cursor who is trained for day-long, long-distance running to determine what is legally a Seisin to that Covenant.
	- Legacy - Legacies are Vis sources too distant to be considered a Seisin. Traditionally, once a Covenant finds a Vis source that would be a legacy, they gain legal right to harvest it for seven years (or till the next Tribunal meeting) once they report it. Every Tribunal, every Covenant can move to have their legacies be renewed through a Tribunal vote, though this is usually very difficult for newer Covenants. Legacies that are not renewed become...
	- Tropaeum - Tropea are owned by the Tribunal. The Tribunal harvests these Vis sources, though a Covenant may attempt to gain a lease for one as well. That said, these are only the easy Vis sources, the ones too hard become…
	- Luctatio - Vis sources deemed too difficult or dangerous to be Tropea. Any Magus may attempt to harvest Vis from a Luctatio, but it may be ill advised.
- There are a number of differences in the peripheral code to what one might normally assume. In particular:
	- The rules on Vis sources (see above)
	- Books held in common by the Tribunal, which may only be consulted if the Covenant has gained access through Tourney victory.
	- Raiding of mundane resources is not considered to be “depriving a member of the Order of his magical power”. That is to say, stealing anything another Covenant owns, so long as it is not directly related to magic (I.E. Vis, laboratory ware, books), is perfectly legal. This also stretches to include the killing of covenfolk, though not Familiars or Apprentices.
	- The town Senex; the Covenant in which a town’s bells ring most loudly, for a given town. The Senex of any given town has primacy for the use of that town. That is to say, “meddling” with mundanes and bringing ruin on one's sodales are viewed incredibly lightly.
	- Urban Covenants, that is to say Covenants which exist inside of a town, may exist, and are not inherently interfering. Furthermore Covenants may be granted a town charter by a mundane lord, and this is also not interfering. However, Magi at the Covenant may not take advantage of the privileges of the charter, as doing so would be effectively swearing an oath of fealty.
	- In general, they weigh the whole “Bringing ruin upon my sodales” much heavier than “Interfering with mundanes”. As long as you don’t bring (direct) ruin on your sodalis, you’re likely within the code.
- A tradition started by a Bonisagus Magus is that any Magi may donate a book to the Tribunal in general, and if it is of reasonable quality, the Magus gains an automatic prize at the next Tribunal. This tradition is often followed, and it’s considered good form to donate a newly written book, if it might be of interest.
- The location of the Tribunal Meeting every seven years is randomized between all Covenants, and the Covenant must support both the Tribunal meeting and the following tourney. Though this seems like something that is meant to be more flexible to help younger Covenants, the costs of putting this on are usually quite damaging to them.
- Following the Tribunal meeting, the hosting Covenant puts on a grand tourney, made of six events, one of which is of the Covenant’s own choosing. The various placements of each Covenant in the final results earn them glory and a reward of vis, which they may trade for books, Vis source leases or other things. 
- Given the nature of the Tribunal, most Magi and Covenants are more likely to accidentally meddle with mundane affairs. To avoid this, Magi act through agents called “Masks”. Magi are only considered meddling with mundanes if said mundanes retaliate directly against Magi. Their agents are not considered in this manner.
## Local Flavour & Trivia
- In the Forest of Broceliande, there is a fountain of youth that can seemingly make someone who washes their face in it look younger, but the effects are both faerie and temporary. This is also where Merlin supposedly ran into the Lady of the Lake, Viviane.
- Within Brittany is the fabled site of the town of Is, where a demon seduced and tricked Princess Dahut to open the flood gates, destroying the town. Her spirit still acts as a siren in the area, called Marie-Morgane.
- South of Gennes there is an ancient Roman Amphitheater. Next to it is a magic Regio, which has a number of water nymphs that will happily talk to visitors about the water cult that honored them in the old days.
- Around Le Cite is a famous delicacy in the region; truffles. They are usually found in the winter months up to March by dogs and pigs, but some occasionally do end up as Herbam vis.
- Within Paris, there is a Beggar King that commands and controls all beggars in the area, of all stripes. This figure uses their men to take cuts of all begging in the area, and the true identity of the King is unknown.
- There is a town named St. Cloud in the Ile de France, and there is a bridge there. It is said that any king that sets foot on the bridge will be struck down dead. No one knows if this is true, but no king has dared try it.
- There are numerous monasteries on Mt Auxois, and on the holy mountain is a fountain dedicated to St Reina. She was martyred by a Roman governor who chopped off her head after she refused to wed him. The fountain spontaneously sprung up. It was a pilgrimage site, but it has been mostly forgotten.
- The Merovingian sorcerer kings also once ruled France as they did the Rhine. In fact, every line of kings has something supernatural about their line.
- Death himself wanders around Brittany with a wagon and a scythe, and sometimes a boat for the islands. Hearing him coming is a bad omen, and meeting him is certain... death.
- The area of Carnac is infamous in the region. It has over 1000 menhirs, of gigantic size. This is the place Trianoma is said to have met Diedne. The locals insist that demons cavort at night.
- The former Domus Magna of House Diedne, Branugurix, was situated at Mt. Dol. This was where the final battle of the Schism War was fought. After Magi went in, the Regio Branugurix was closed up, trapping them inside. No one knows what happened.
- Paris is the largest city in Western Europe. Despite being covered by the Dominion, it may be an excellent place to make contacts, find Gifted children, or raise funds.
- Ypres regards the plethora of cats they have as creatures of the devil. Once a year they gather them all in bags, and throw them off the top of the belfry of their Cloth Hall, killing them. This is called “Cat Hurling”, and many players of this game would consider this act “kind of fucked up”.
## Character and Covenant Ideas
### Magi
- Given the tradition of gifting books to the common Tribunal, it is a bit easier for a Bonisagus researcher that wishes to spread their ideas.
- With House Tytalus constantly challenging and there needing to be a constant force of law, House Guernicus has its work cut out for it.
- House Tremere is not very common in this Tribunal and many Tytalus enjoy taunting the House as the elder brother taunts the younger. Could you be one of the unlucky few assigned to this region?
- The ancient romances lead to numerous Fae stories and ancient tales that are of great interest to House Merinita.
- The majority of House Bjornaer members in the region are heavily Harmonist, and much of the wild has been tamed by cities and towns, and it is in the Magi’s best interest to learn to manage it. There is also a cave in the area commonly used for Clan Ilfetu’s rituals.
- House Flambeau tends to favor the raw glory of knightly romance if they are not a soldiery sort, and are fond of the great tourney as it is like their own house’s tourney.
- This is House Tytalus’s seat of power, and they cause great conflict and intrigue in the Region. Currently, there are two challengers to the seat of Primus of the house, and all Tytalus in the region have picked their side and are participating (or being used) in that intrigue.
- This is (arguably) the most mundanely integrated Tribunal, and House Jerbiton certainly are experts at dealing with mundanes more so than their sodales.
- House ex Misc Traditions common in the Area.
	- Donatores Requietis Aeternae
	- Pharmacopoeians
	- Beast Master
	- Atsingani (seers)
### Companions
* In a Tribunal with themes of knightly romance, Knights are a fairly obvious choice. This also includes a friendly noble that is covering for the Covenant.
- The Dominion is strong here, so any sort of priestly character would fit in fairly nicely.
- A professional operative, or Mask, would be a good choice for any companion that wants to work as the primary agent of the Covenant.
- The sheer amount of towns and cities can lend themselves to merchants and craftsmen of many stripes.
- The faerie wife of a count called Melusine had many children with him, and her blood still appears in their descendents. They usually have a random odd physical change, like drooping ears, ork-like tusks, retractable claws. All of them have the blood of water spirits, and are somehow related to the Count of Poiters.
- The Knights Templar are also in the region, as it is the center of their massive vault and banking operation.
### Example Covenant Sites
To start a new Covenant, you are probably going to need a liege. There are five great lieges.
1. Fudarus - The Domus Magna of House Tytalus. Located off the coast of Brittany. Given its only members are the two dueling and intriguing for the spot of Primus, it isn’t easy to get them to listen. It may be easier to get another Covenant to sponsor you. That said, its only vassal has quite the generous oath of fealty for themselves, seemingly the two Primi are too busy with each other to care too much for their vassal, which is also where the rest of the Tytali went, fleeing Fudarus.
2. Oleron - A Covenant, with a Merinita majority, which exists primarily in a faerie Regio. Once a year the queen’s consort can be challenged for leadership of the Covenant and her daughter’s hand in marriage. Win, and you become the consort to the next queen, her daughter. Oleron usually has to deal with the machinations of Fudarus consistently, so it usually looks for vassals that can defend themselves well.
3. Montverte - A Covenant that has a pet lord doing their bidding, whose castle they live in. They are major troublemakers in the region, holding their vassals to their oaths very seriously, and expecting them to act in their machinations. They do provide them a number of benefits though. They “invented” the practice of Hermetic raiding.
4. Florum - A Covenant heavily focused on the industrialized parts of the area. They do intense manufacturing. They are going to be the nicest and easiest to get along with, however,  since they are attempting to forge their own Tribunal with their vassals and with some Rhine Covenants, the vassal Covenant will likely get wrapped up in that.
5. Confluensis - The Quaesitor Covenant and formerly the home of the Praeco of the Tribunal until she recently died, this Covenant sees itself as the bastion of order in the chaotic Tribunal. Confluensis is in the middle of a crisis, and the majority of its vassals are Mercer Houses. However, a Covenant as a play for stability may be in the cards.
Locations (note, these locations may be more appropriate to different lieges. Suggested lieges are by location and assumptions of the author)
- South of Corseul is the remains of a Roman temple to Mars. Within it is a Regio where the temple stands in its full glory. (Fudarus, Montverte, Confluensis)
- There is a series of islands called the Seven Islands (Sept-Îles). Though small, they have a number of Vis sources and magic auras within the archipelago. (Fudarus, Montverte)
- In recently annexed territory is a vacation castle on the Cotentin Peninsula. It is said there is a dangerous magical creature there related to Grendel. Current expeditions have found nothing (but some Grogs have recently disappeared), and there is a strong magical aura. If the Covenant can deal with the local lords, settling the place somehow, it could be a good place to set up in. (Confluensis)
- South of Tours near the river is an area with many small settlements and numerous caves. There is a nearby enclosed valley with a small source of Aquam vis, with numerous open caves. (Oleron, Montverte)
- The small island of Noirmoutier is right off the western coast. It used to be a site sacred to Gaelic druids, and the island has a rough current around it, making it difficult to approach. However, seafood is readily available, and the marshes can easily provide a great deal of sea salt. (Oleron)
- In the center of a forest on the eastern end of Flanders lies a Roman crossroads that acted as a supply center and a sacred site to Mercury. On any day, one of the seven roads from the center provides a clear route to the end of the road. Despite being overgrown, and despite the distance, it only takes a morning’s travel to reach the end of it. On May 15th, all roads have this property, and some footprints on the road may be harvested for vis. (Florum)
- In the small village called Nours, they are hiding a massive cave complex under the small town that could easily hold 1000 souls, and may contain a powerful genus loci. There are streets, brewers, bakers, and blacksmiths in the caves. The villagers prefer to not talk about the caves mostly just to take advantage of them. The entire complex has a relatively weak magic aura. (Florum)
