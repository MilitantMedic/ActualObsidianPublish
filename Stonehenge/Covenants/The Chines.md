## Tribunal
[[Stonehenge Tribunal]]

## Description
One of several Covenants set up close to the great magical landscape of the Stonehenge stones and their environs – this one at a safe distance, with its headquarters (established forty years ago) on the Isle of Wight, presenting themselves to the world as “humble scholars”. Rumours hint at a series of problems having beset the Covenant in recent years, including the violent death of its leader.
