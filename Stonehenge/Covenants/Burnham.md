## Tribunal
[[Stonehenge Tribunal]]
## Members
[[Stephanus of Tytalus]]
[[Melisende of Jerbiton]]
[[Gilbert Tacet of Mercere]]
## Description
A new covenant (~20 years) established by Tytalus Archmagus [[Stephanus of Tytalus]]. Doesn't seem to be a covenant there at all. Just a happy farming community overseen by the amiable "Stephen of Norwich"

Actually a stepson wives style village. Where all is good and safe. Actually a good place. The library and laboratories lay hidden beneath idyllic cottages.  

The greatest single conspiracy that Burnham is involved in is, of course, the conspiracy to control the Tribunal without the usual Tribunal Meetings. But Stephanus makes no effort to actually run this conspiracy. On the contrary, he has contrived a situation where the magi of three powerful Covenants â€“ Blackthorn, The Chines, and Sanguis Vento all think that they initiated the idea of rendering the meetings inquorate.

[[Melisende of Jerbiton]] is succeeding in her mission to create a more perfect society. She hires the best priest, ensures the best troupe passes through town and so on.

### Allies
[[Blackthorn]] [[The Chines]] [[Sanguis Vento]] are all convinced by Stephanus that it is beneficial to them to keep the tribunal inquorate.
### Enemies
[[other covenant]]
