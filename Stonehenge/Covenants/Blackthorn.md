## Tribunal
[[Stonehenge Tribunal]]

## Members
1 Guernicus 8 Tremere.
[[Talion of Tremere]]
[[Iudicium of Guernicus]]
[[Fornax of Tremere]]

## Description
Founded around the year 900ad, the Grand Old Covenant. Hidden amidst caves in southern Wales. It has been powerful, weak, and everything in between over its lifetime. These days assumed to be powerful, but largely reclusive and low profile.

They began to pry into what seemed to be some sort of elemental darkness â€“ a living, moving, motivated (though seemingly unintelligent) mass of magical dark which spread its tendrils through countless miles of cracks and crevasses and caves.
Their leader became possessed by the dark and was slain by [[Iudicium of Guernicus]]. The covenant decided based on this, and an interest in not being questioned about their research, to ensure the Tribunal was Inquorate. [[Stephanus of Tytalus]] facilitated this in return for access to their research.

Moved into the caverns under the mountains (to where [[Tagelyn]] used to be) and researched most unwisely. The darkness struck back, and now they have retreated to the upper caverns, fighting the darkness daily. Rego Vim and Rego Ignem rituals keep the covenant safe
### Allies
[[Burnham]], specifically [[Stephanus of Tytalus]].
[[Coeris]], due to being a Tremere stronghold.

### Enemies
[[Ashenrise]]

## History
Helped [[Tagelyn]] be founded, a covenant of 4 Magi, led by [[Fornax of Tremere]]. They became uppity kicking out their only Tremere member, and spurning Blackthorn, eventually failing at raiding Blackthorn itself. Blackthorn rallied their local nobles and declared Wizard's War against the Magi of [[Tagelyn]], slaying 1 Magus, and most of their covenfolk. Those 2 Magi who survived founded [[Ashenrise]], and hold a grudge against Blackthorn.
