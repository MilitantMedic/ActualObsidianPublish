## Description
Founded in 815 AD. The (ancient) domus magna of House Ex Miscellanea i.e. the home of Ex Miscellanea’s leader, [[Immanola of ex Miscellanea]] somewhere in north Wales. The leading Covenant of a whole House should be an important place. But most people have no idea how to find Cad Gadu, and anyone who does stumble on it is told to leave, whoever they are. Ex Miscellanea’s leader, it seems, has no interest in leading anything.

A small island, ringed by twelve-foot-high cliffs, with just three little cottages and a landing jetty with tower. The island stands in a small lake. On the island are the cottages, and two pillars flanking a white paved path, which leads off the edge of the island (the true entrance to Cad Ganu).
