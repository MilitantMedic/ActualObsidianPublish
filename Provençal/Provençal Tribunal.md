The Provençal Tribunal covers southern France from Toulouse to the Pyrenees. It is delineated from the Normandy tribunal by language, whether or not the people in the area affirm with ‘Oc over ‘Oil, the language being Occitan. It is currently being subjected to a massive Crusade against the Cathar population, and the crown of North France is using it as an excuse to subjugate the region.

## Why would I want to play in the Provençal Tribunal?

- You want to face the repercussions of a violent religious crusade, in progress and its aftermath.
- You want to build on the ruins of numerous Roman cities, southern French cities, and Covenants.
- You want to deal with complications of heresy, the Church, and the Infernal.
- You want to play in the most “balanced” (or default) Tribunal; legally, politically, in mundane relations, and in magical power.
## Vis Level

Mid
Despite recent events, magical areas are still relatively plentiful in the Provençal tribunal. Vis isn’t rare enough to have intricate rulings about it, but it is still quite valuable. There are a number of Roman ruins about, and various mystical places of import. And, unfortunately, due to the Crusade there are a number of infernal places of power that have sprung up from the events.
## State of Hermetic Politics

The biggest and most obvious question plaguing the Tribunal is the reaction to the Albigensian Crusade. Numerous Covenants have been destroyed in its path, and the pressure of Northern France invading the region is being felt. Some Covenants refuse to participate, and are threatening to split the Tribunal if pressured into doing so. Others do want to do something about it, but there is a further split between those that want to fight the crusade, and those that may want to fight with it. The next Tribunal is sure to be chaotic.
Recently the Head Quaesitor has also been slain under mysterious circumstances. His former eldest Filius has the position for now, but no one has found out how the man was killed, and it puts a deep shadow over the tribunal.

## State of Mundane Politics

The Albigensian Crusade against the Cathars has fired up again after a brief lull. In 1217, the leader of the crusading forces, the French Knight Simon de Montfort, died attempting to besiege the city of Toulouse, a siege stone striking him in the head. The Count of Toulouse and leader of the region, Count Raimond VI (one of many Raimonds in this conflict) returned earlier after one of his many excommunications during this conflict was rescinded. Simon’s son and wife nominally control the area he conquered.

In 1219 the French royal court restarted the crusade to destroy the Cathars, and incorporate South France into the greater French state. Count Raimond is still fighting against them.
## New Covenant Setup Requirements

Setting up a Covenant in the Provençal Tribunal is easier than in most any other Tribunal. A group of Magi must just come together for a common goal, draw up a charter, and swear the oath. The only legal aspect is a Quaesitor notarizing the charter. That is all that is required.

It is considered to be in good taste to alert the local Mercer house that you exist, and to announce the Covenant’s existence at the next Tribunal. This easy process has had the side effect of there being tons of ruined Covenants in the Tribunal, and stumbling upon their ruins is fairly easy.
## Hermetic Culture

Provençal is mostly meant to be the typical tribunal in terms of Order of Hermes culture, so it has the fewest variations.
- An odd quirk of the code, Covenant charters are considered part of the Peripheral Code, so disputes that would normally be handled internally are brought to the attention of the whole Tribunal.
- Mystery Cults are extremely common and important to the makeup in the Provençal Tribunal. Here are some examples:
- The Legion of Mithras: One of the most publicly known Mystery Cults, most in the Order know of them. Known for their stalwart defense of the Order of Hermes, many Hoplites are members. They recruit Magi with heroic virtues: Bravery, honesty, diligence, and loyalty. Militarily minded, and strongly regimented. 
- The Cult of Mercury and the Neo Mercurians: The Cult of Mercury worship the Roman deity Mercury, believing that Mercere was the incarnation of the god. They’re rather open about this, and any Magus who wishes to learn are welcome. The Neo Mercurians are a mystery cult proper. Not much is known publicly about them, but rumors abound of cultic sacrifice of animals.
- The Knights of the Green Stone: A cult of knightly troubadours, who care deeply for chivalric love. Their ultimate quest is to gain the Stone of Heaven, said to have fallen from Lucifer’s brow when he was smited by the Archangel Michael.
- The Matres and Matrones: Dedicated to the advancement of women. The current Praeco (oldest Magus of the Tribunal) Dama of Merinita is a key figure. An obscure cult, but not entirely secretive.
- This is the seat of power for House Flambeau, so there is often a fiery energy in many of the Magi of the region. Hot tempers and intense opinions are common, and the crusade is not helping this.
## Local Flavour & Trivia

- In Toulouse, the hated bishop Foulques De Marseilles created the White Brotherhood in 1209 to destroy the poison of heresy and moneylenders, oppose Count Raimond, and support the crusade. They dressed up in white robes and hoods and committed midnight arrests and acts of terror. Soon a Black Brotherhood formed, who fought the White Brotherhood on the streets protecting Cathars and Jews. This has died down, but both are still intermittently active.
- Most heresy is usually found in universities or simply uncommon, but in the Provençal region it is painfully common. The most obvious heretics are the subjects of the crusade, the Cathars, who are a somewhat Gnostic order of believers who believe the material world is suffering, and therefore bringing children into the world is evil. There are also the Waldensians, who are proto Protestant, and the Luciferians who believe that Lucifer was good.
- Within a Faerie Regio in Gascony is the castle of Rosefleur. Inside the castle is the ruler of faeries for the region, the lady Oriande la Fée. The Gauls worshiped her as an aspect of the goddess Sirona, but she has changed her role to a challenger to those who travel the pilgrimage routes of the Ways of St James.
- In 1218, Amaury de Montfort, son of Simon de Montfort, led his crusaders into the town of Marmande. They slaughtered all 5000 residents.
- In the Pyrenees is the Breach of Roland, where the famous Paladin Roland attempted to destroy his sword Durendal.
- There is a spring near Nimes which has a shrine to Heracles created by the Gauls. Some claim it actually contains an ancient altar consecrated to a magic spirit known as Volcae.
- Mt Ventoux is the source of the famous wind of the area known as the Mistral. The upper part of the mountain houses a magical Regio. The Regio is filled with terrifying winds and incredibly dangerous conditions. In the center is the greater Daimon known as Ventoux, who unleashes his children across the region.
- There are demons along the Way of St. James, who try to tempt and corrupt pilgrims. They are known as the Six Deadly Spirits.
- The space between the Provençal tribunal and the Normandy Tribunal does not have a strict border. It is determined by whether the natives speak Occitan or not. It has become somewhat of a badge of honor in the Tribunal, and native Magi write books in both Latin and Occitan.
- The Praeco of the Tribunal, Dama, is one of the oldest Magi in the Order, apparently mostly due to a number of strange twilight episodes. She is well respected.
- The Albigensian Crusade is where the famous quote, “Kill them all, and God will know his own” comes from. It was attributed to Bishop Arnaud Armaury during the siege of Beziers to kill Raimond-Rogier Trencavel. 20,000 died that day. Bizarrely, Armaury now supports Count Raimond of Toulouse despite formerly being on the side of the crusade. He now recognizes the threat of northern French expansion.
- After being banned in Toulouse, the Jewish quarter of Cahors is the primary place to go when you need to raise money fast. It also is the source of the local “Black Wine” which is famous across Europe.
- The Via Domitia is a route that passes through the region where Heracles supposedly completed his 12 labors.
- There is a noble bloodline, the Baux family, in the region that traces their lineage back to one of the 3 Wise Men that came to see the birth of Christ, specifically Balthazar.
- There is a massive monastic complex called Grand Chartreuse in the mountain cluster above the town of Grenoble. Most monks there live in seclusion, in small walled courtyards.
## Covenant and Character Ideas

### Magi

- House Guernicus just lost their Chief Quaesitor in Tibaut, and they are short staffed on senior members. His death was mysterious, and a mystery is still there to be solved.
- House Tremere’s primary Covenant was destroyed, containing most of their young members. With the exception of one, all were slain (or more than one if your character is another survivor).
- House Criamon had to force out a tradition of Cathars in their ranks after arguments. The local Clutch still finds the situation untenable.
- House Merinita’s primary members are focused around the Covenant of Ara Maxima Nova, searching out the path of Heracles in the region. Using that as a jumping point, a member of the cult could spread somewhere else for more specific research.
- The Confraternity of Roland is a popular path for house Verditius in the region, and its leader is the Priest of Vulcan at Aedes Mercuri.
- Provençal is the seat of House Flambeau, and their Domus Magna Castra Solis. It also contains their lost ancient former Domus Magna of Val Negra. Perhaps it could be found once again. Either way, the House feels there needs to be some response to the crusade.
- One of Jerbiton’s primary interests is the sprawling Covenant of Coenobium. It is a massive sprawling Covenant in Arelat. It has massive political pull, and contains numerous magi
- The greatest legacy of House Tytalus in the region is Frainetum, a Covenant of pirates right off the coast. It was destroyed by Coenobium after some wizard wars. They probably don’t exist any more. Tytalus also has a poor rep in the area, given they are much more common in the Normandy Tribunal to the north.
- House ex Misc Traditions common in the Area:
	- Hermetic Haruspex
    - Sorginak Witches
    - Lineage of Pralix
    - Gorgiastic Cathar
    - Rusticani
    - Karaites
    - Pharmacopoeians
### Companions

- Troubadours (trobairitz for women) are common traveling performers and entertainers in the region. They are generally popular among the people.
- Notaries are a common academic career in the region to work with contracts and transactions. 
- There are numerous holy orders of knights in the area. The majority are protesting the crusade.
	- Knights Templar
	- Knights Hospitaller 
	- Knights of St James the Sword
	- Knights of the Order of Aubrac
- There are a number of Jewish schools and scholars in the southern parts of the region.
- Also, quite a number of Moorish raiders and traders in the southern ports.
- There is also plenty of time for heresy, as a Cathar, Waldensian, or Luciferian.
- In the Pyrenees is also the Basque culture, which is unique in the region. Said to have many witches.
- A crusader from the north may have decided to quit. 
### Example Covenant Sites

- La Romieu - Near this village is the wreckage of a former Diedne Covenant. There are numerous magical cats there from what is believed to be the Diedne lineage. There is a magic aura that encompasses a number of Sandstone Pyramidal monuments, and a cave complex. The original Covenant was destroyed by rampaging Flambeau Magi, so its structural integrity is questionable.
- The Bramabiau Gorge - There is a large cave in this region in between two small towns. Within the cave and beyond a waterfall are numerous fetishes and gallery paintings which may be a source of knowledge for Fertility Magic. The magic aura increases on nights of a full moon.
- Tarascon - Just outside the city of Tarascon is the former lair of the Tarasque. It is a cave network that could possibly lead to deeper Regiones, with ancient children and cousins of the famous dragon.
- The Barbagel Ruins - Just north of Arles is the ruined Verditius Covenant of Barbagel and the Roman ruins of an ancient water wheel. An engineer there supposedly was able to get the water wheel to obtain different types of Vis other than Vim Vis from magic auras. The ruins do fall in the general massive territory of the Coenobium, so they may find someone settling in this location irritating.
- The Isle d’Yf - An uninhabited island off the coast of Marseilles in a series of islands filled with pirates, smugglers and raiders, d’Yf has an ancient grove of yew trees that provide Vis via the tree branches. The branches of the oldest one gifts the ability to speak to the dead.
