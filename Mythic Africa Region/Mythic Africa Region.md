NOTE: There are themes of slavery in this area that are hard to ignore.
Mythic Africa is a strange place, full of strange peoples. There are no Hermetic Covenants here, due to an agreement with the Hermetic Sahirs. They asked for no one to settle these lands for 275 years. Why that specific amount of time is unknown. That time ended in the year 1200, but no Hermetic has yet settled here.

There is no central great mythic power in Africa. Not like the Order of Hermes in Europe, or the Order of Suleiman in the Near East. That does not mean there are no strong spirits, or powerful wizards. And small traditions abound.

It is speculated, both by European, and Islamic wise men, that the southern end of Africa lies to the north of the Great Ocean, which spans the equator. One must first pass the Torrid Zone which is where the sun is closest to the earth, a land of extreme heat somewhere in the south of the great desert.
## Why would i want to play in Mythic Africa
- You want to be at the edge of the world. Exploring new lands and new peoples.
- You don’t want to be tied down by worries of “Interfering with the mundanes”. Since there are no other Covenants for damage to be blown back on, nor are there strong enough mundanes to take their grievances out on Magi in a completely different tribunal (you hope).
- You want to live in a place untouched by the Church. No monasteries or abbeys to compete with you for builders, nor land.
- You want to experience the intersection between Arabs and desert nomads.
## Vis Level
Medium - There are many traditions, but not many individuals looking for Vis. On the other hand, much of the desert is off limits, as far as searching for Vis goes (which is speculated to be where all the good Vis is)

## State of Hermetic Politics
None.

## State of Mundane Politics
### Northern Africa
Much of northern Africa is ruled by the Almohad Caliphate, Arabs. The Almohads split their focus between their African and Iberian holdings. They have twin capitals, Marrakesh in Africa, and Sevilla in Iberia. The current Caliph is only 17 years old. They suffered a crippling defeat at the battle of Las Navas de Tolosa where over 100,000 soldiers were lost to the Christian forces. There is much instability, with many uncles and cousins trying to maximise their influence over the Caliph. The local governors pay lip service to the Almohads, waiting for their opportunity to break free.

A Berber tribe, the Marinids hold the Rif. Opposing the Almohads, this is a staging ground for raids into Almohad territory to the west.

### The Great Desert
A mix of Berber, Tuareg, and Banu Khalida tribes (see “other trivia”). There are many oases and some towns that have sprung up around them. The exact location of the tribes is always changing.

## Local Flavour & Trivia
- The fastest (and safest) way to travel the coasts is by boat. Raiders and brigands abound on the inland roads.
- According to different tales, the Island of Monkeys, Pithecousa, lies either amongst the Balearic islands, off the coast of Gibraltar, or past the pillars of Hercules. What is agreed on is that on landing on the island, everyone is transformed into a monkey. This effect fades upon leaving the island.
- Marrakesh is perhaps the grandest city in the region. It’s great marketplace and souk, the Djemaa El Fna is filled with traders from all over.
- Fes is the second biggest city, reinvigorated by refugees from Iberia. It has the oldest madrasa (university equivalent) in the entirety of Africa, and is very religiously diverse.
- Tunis is the largest port in the Maghreb, and a great naval power. The local governor is said to have very little love for the Almohads.
- Carthage lies a very short distance from Tunis. It is said that on some days, the wind sounds like people speaking in an unknown language.
- Tripoli is the gateway to the desert. It is very friendly to dhimmi as it imports a huge amount of food from the Christian world.
- About a quarter of the Great Desert is ergs (dunes). The rest is arid land, rocks, and gravel. People who know the desert well are capable of living in it, or at least surviving passages through it, making stops at oases and wadis.
- In the region of Fezzan ancient Garamatian sorcerer kings led armies of the dead, and used them for agriculture and mining. They became a client state of Rome in 15 BC, and were later conquered and made extinct with the coming of Islam. The last king was taken away in chains in 668, and the culture died out. Garama was their capital and has been picked over, at least on the surface.
- The Central Great Desert is, more than any other desert, truly scarce of water. This is the land of Tuaregs and Berbers. The Tuaregs mainly control territory centred around the great Tademaït Plateau.
- The Tanezrouft Desert, in the west, is truly desolate. Hardly anyone lives here, as it is without useful resources. The only people around are caravans, and some Tuareg nomads.
- The Ténéré Desert’s Aïr mountains have been a stronghold for the Tuareg since time immemorial. The Ténéré Desert is generally harsh, but has good oases and many mines.
- Imazighen or Berbers are the dominant African culture, allied to the Tuaregs. Berbers are often tattooed, especially the women. In Berber culture, there is no (official) leader of a group, houses are the same size. Men take care of everything outside the house, and women everything inside. There is (quite) strict sexual segregation. A man and a woman who do not have a prior relationship may not speak with each other at all. Women are more often literate. The men make decisions in the Tajmat, a council whose members are based on occupation, and control public behavior. The women make decisions at Tala, where they care for the dead, and police private behavior. The Berbers are overwhelmingly Ibadi Muslims, with a few tribes being Christian, or Pagan.
- All Men of the Tuaregs, or Kel Tagelmoust (people who wear the veil), always wear a dark blue veil, even while eating or sleeping. Natural raiders, Tuareg have a reputation for treachery. Tuaregs consider the only things of significant value to be camels, clothing, slaves, and weapons. Tuareg women are highly respected and are not veiled, they often assume leadership roles. Nobility is inherited matrilineally.
- At the edge of the torrid zone dwells the Banu Khalida. They have 2 groupings of castes, the “white” ruling castes, and the “black” servant castes (not based on skin colour). They speak Punic, crossed with Arabic and Tamazight. They live in 12 (small) cities, ruled by 12 Emirs. Each city is roughly a day's journey from the next and connected with paved roads, centered on oases. They consider religion a very private affair, and their mosques are hardly used, even dilapidated. Some claim they are demon worshippers.
- Across the great deserts trade flows. Primarily, gold, slaves, and salt drive the traffic north, and all manner of goods, but primarily slaves, glass and horses, go south. Some of the other goods taken north include ivory, gum arabic, ostrich feathers, kola nuts, ebony, and cloth. Caravans going south take dates, figs, sugar, cowries (sea snails), copper, ironwork, paper, books, tools, weapons, cotton, and silk to serve as currency with the nomads. Berber and Tuareg nomads make up the majority of the traders from the south, bringing caravans with hundreds of camels and slaves into the markets twice a year, in March and November. The people of the far south are the Sudanese. Not much is known about them as they stop traders at oases outside their cities and trade there.
## Character and Covenant Ideas
### Magi
- Magi Trianomae seekers might be interested in Punic magic, or perhaps the Garamation sorcerer kings.
- House Tremere always wants to keep an eye on new developments in the order. It’d not be a stretch that they’d send someone to spy (and help out, of course)
- A Bjornaer Magus would be interested in the strange beasts of the area, many of which no one has had as a heartbeast before.
- There are no House ex Misc Traditions common in the Area, but these could develop.
- The Lineage of Pralix is always interested in attempting to integrate hedge traditions.
- Settuten are a tradition of female moon magicians of Berber and Tuareg heritage. They have both Gifted and un-gifted members. Their magics allow travelling great distances, dismissing supernatural creatures and perhaps even disallowing magic entirely. They have an enemy in the form of Sahirs, seeing them as part of the invading/suppressive Arabs.
- Murabitin are male holy men, who are said to create amulets of protection and divine the future.
- There may still exist remnants of the tradition of the Garamatian sorcerer kings. If so they would likely be necromancers.
### Companions
- A Berber woman might be sick of the strict delineation of male and female spheres.
- Tuareg are said to become more and more strange with time, eventually becoming “blue men of the desert”. Some might seek the Order to live out their last years, or to attempt to be cured.
- Banu Khalida warriors are said to be worthy of 10 outsiders, and are always looking for a fight. 
- There is a Berber tradition of dream interpretation through ancestor spirits. Not strictly necessary but hugely helpful is resting near an ancestor’s tomb.
- Settuten have both Gifted and un-gifted members (see House ex Misc tradtions).
- Many rich Arabs believe that the best way to protect themselves, or their caravans, from depredation is by hiring bodyguards. Unfortunately due to the web of clan loyalties, a bodyguard from the Berbers or Tuaregs is unreliable. Therefore second (or third or fourth or…) sons of European background are often preferred.
### Example Covenant Sites
- No one lives on the island of Mogador off the western coast. It is said that a bloodthirsty monster lays claim to it. Around the island are special sea snails, whose crushed shells are used to dye cloth in Tyrian purple.
- Walili contains the remnants of an ancient Roman town. The aqueduct fell into disrepair so the locals moved to a nearby wadi (river valley), leaving the town as a cemetery. The main Roman road survives, as do some buildings.
- There is a story from Roman times, of a great serpent slain by a Roman general at the mouth of the Bagradas river, 20 miles north of Tunis. If the story is true, then a creature of that size surely has a lair with a magical aura.
- Leptis Magna is an abandoned city of Roman design. There are still many Roman buildings, including a lighthouse and walls. There is not enough arable land to feed anyone living there, so the only people around are travellers.
- Somewhere in the desert, perhaps at an oasis. Very desolate, but almost completely isolated from pesky Hermetics, or even mundanes, except for on rare occasions. If negotiated properly with, the Tuareg’s Aïr mountain passes have many caves and allows one to be closer to mundanes.
