Situated entirely in Ireland, this Tribunal has long been on the fringes of the Order. It has developed a Hermetic culture that most other Magi consider bizarre and backwater. However, thanks to both the English invading after a particular book was written, and the death of a continental Magus there bringing the full wrath of that Magus’s Parens upon the Tribunal, this Tribunal normally full of casual local conflict suddenly is under pressure from outside forces acting upon it.

## Why would I want to play in the Hibernian Tribunal?
- You want to play a unique Hermetic climate more willing to work alongside, or at least near, Hedge Traditions.
- You want to deal with a tale as old as time in Ireland; the English invading. This also includes foreign magi coming to reform the Code.
- You want to play in a Tribunal where the supernatural is significantly more obvious to the mundane population and to Magi alike.
- You want to examine the culture of both native, English, and, Continental Magi.
## Vis Level
Mid - High (Leaning Mid)

While most Vis sources give little, there is a massive amount of them in the Tribunal, albeit by tradition most Magi do not harvest Vis till they need it. Magical races live on the island, with the Fir Bolg even having their own bishopric over their people. Many fairies are common to run into, and many Magi are familiar with them.  
## State of Hermetic Politics
Tribunal politics has been overwhelmed by the actions of Ballack of Tytalus and his allies getting revenge for the death of his former apprentice and occupying the Covenant of Praesis with his allies. With him came a wave of English and continental Magi who heard about the Tribunal Peripheral Code, and have come to reform it. The local elder Magi found this abhorrent, of course, but Ballack did everything according to the rules, so they were unable to form a reasonable response. And even then, many of the younger Magi see this chaos as a chance to either make a name for themselves or shake things up in the Tribunal, as they've been wanting to do for ages.

## State of Mundane Politics
Ireland has for a long while been a vassal of England but governed very loosely, and there had been numerous direct invasion attempts, of course by singular lords. This changed when Prince John and his cohort Gerald of Wales (a Welsh cleric) visited Ireland to review the baronies. Gerald wrote about his journeys and published a couple popular books; Topography of Ireland and Conquest of Ireland. Despite the trip being successful for relations (the locals seemed to like Prince John’s lack of tact), the books put Ireland on the mind of the King of England (Henry III) and he felt an earlier Papal Bull gave him the right to conquer Ireland and reform its Church.

The English began pushing deeper into Ireland and more directly pressuring areas under their control. Though some are going somewhat native, the Irish lords are getting more and more irritated, chafing under English rule.
## New Covenant Setup Requirements

Any Magi may form a Covenant in Ireland, requiring three things; land, wealth, and a treasure.

- Land - Any space upon which the Magi may create a home. They must have protected this land for a year for this to be valid.
- Wealth - Historically in Ireland, this means cattle. To be a valid Covenant in Hibernia, you must have a herd of cattle.
- Treasure - Or more commonly referred to as a Cathach. A Cathach is a magical treasure or relic with some significance to the Covenant. To be a valid Cathach, it must be:
	- Magical - It doesn’t need to be Hermetic or magic realm specifically, but should be able to be sensed as mystical in some fashion.
	- Taken - You cannot make your own Cathach, you must take it from somewhere. The process of taking is important, as it becomes part of your Covenant’s story.
	- Significant - The Cathach needs to have a story behind it, either being legendary itself, or made by someone legendary.
	- Displayed - The Cathach must be brought to the Tribunal to prove it exists and you have right of residency, and then displayed outside the Covenant’s Aegis of the Hearth.
If the Magi can maintain and protect all of these for one year, they have the right to represent themselves at the Tribunal. Other Magi may attempt to take the Cathach before the year is over, and thus the Covenant cannot form. They must still obey the Code however.
## Hermetic Culture
- In the rest of the Order, a Wizard’s War lasts solely for one month. In Hibernia, it lasts as long as the Magi involved perpetuate it. If enough time goes without any participating Magi trying to continue it, it is considered over. Also, declaring it must be public instead of having the declaration be delivered to all targeted Magi. Most targets of a Wizard’s War are not given the full time to prepare, only hearing about it a week or two before instead of a full month.  
- Any Magi caught stealing a Cathach loses all protections of the Code and may be slain until they successfully protect the Cathach for a year. If successful at stealing it, the Covenant they stole it from is effectively dissolved. This is highly uncommon though, though it may prove troublesome with the incoming foreign Magi.
- The local Magi have a treaty with the local Hedge Wizards to give them some autonomy instead of just breaking them underfoot. The Hedge traditions are given Connacht to live in, and no Hermetic Covenants may exist there. That said, these traditions are still subjugated to the Order of Hermes ultimately, and must provide seven Gifted children to the Order every seven years. Most continental Magi believe the treaty is disrespectful to the Code of Hermes. These Hedge Wizards are called the Coill Trí, and the treaty the Cnoc Maol Réidh.
- Hedge Wizards, magical beings, and Faeries have some degree of rights in the Tribunal, and all have emissaries to the Tribunal meetings. That said, some of the Tribunal’s magi, who are willing to pummel each other plenty, are certainly willing to pummel some of these supernatural folks.
- After apprenticeship, many apprentices in Ireland have a year of running around and causing chaos to make a name for themselves after apprenticeship. This is called the Macgnímartha. During this time their Parens is not responsible for their actions. They usually try to test their new might against faeries, mundanes, or even Hermetic targets. They can also legally go into Connacht and mess with the Hedge Wizards. Notably they have no Parma Magica during this time. After about a year, they return home with something of a reputation, and are admitted into the Order.  
## Local Flavour & Trivia
- There is a social standing among the Irish population called Eraic, which acts as their reputation. It also determines how many cows they must own, and how many cows their killer must pay a man’s family as compensation.
- Near the town of Sligo is the hill of Cnoc Na Ré. Its summit has a massive tomb of loose stones, 180 ft across and 35 ft tall. This is the tomb of Queen Meadhbh of Connacht, whose tomb faces Ulster in case they ever try to invade.
- On a hill above the town of Baltinglass is a rath (circular earthwork or palisade fortress) which houses a mound with a stone doorway. A perpetually burning fire is kept here, and it produces Ignem Vis. Anyone wishing to harvest it must defeat the faerie inhabitants of the mound at a contest of the Faeries choosing. The contest varies year by year based on the faerie guarding the mound.
- The center of the Cistercian monks in Ireland is at Mellifont Abbey, and there are rumors of debauchery and corruption. The French masters of the order have come to investigate and have been locked out of the abbey. This is unprecedented across Christendom.
- Next to the Church of St Flannan is the Ogham Stone. On it is inscribed the message “A Blessing on Thorgrimr” in Ogham, and on the back it says “Thorgrimr carved this cross” in Nordic runes. The stone is clearly magical, though given its proximity to the cathedral it's difficult to study.
- Cashel is the ecclesiastical center of Munster, and the main cathedral, Cormac’s Chapel, is a famous center of learning in the area. While they do not manufacture books, they do have an incredibly large collection.
- Northeast of Croc Áine is Lough Gur, a lake with an evil reputation in the area. Every seven years it disappears for one night, and leaves an impenetrable fog bank in the area. It is surrounded by cairns, and protected by faerie whirlwinds called Sí Gaoith that pull intruders into the lake to drown them.
- One of the most famous pilgrimage sites in the area lies at Lough Dearg, called the Purgatory of St Patrick, which is a pit that depicts both the wonders of heaven and the torments of hell.
- Geasa are still not uncommon within Ireland. These prohibitions can make you better as long as you do not break it, punish you for breaking it, or simply cause you a harmful circumstance. Some hedge wizards can craft these, and many faeries of the old ways are still fond of them.
- The four treasures of the Tuatha de still exist somewhere in Ireland, but they are hidden. The treasures consist of the Spear of Lug, Dagda’s Cauldron, the Stone of Fal, and the Sword of Nuada.
- Fallen Covenants are common in Ireland due to the violent and chaotic nature of the Tribunal. Most Covenants in the Tribunal inevitably have a few ruined Covenants that once existed near their founding.
- The monastery at Kells has the famous Book of Kells, which is believed to have been written by St Columba, though Gerald of Wales believes it was written by an angel. The book is an illuminated copy of the Gospels, and is incredibly beautiful. It is incredibly closely guarded, but may contain some secrets.
## Character and Covenant Ideas
### Magi
- Note that an important decision is whether one is a native of the Tribunal, or an incoming Magus.
- The area has numerous hedge traditions and hedge magics that could be incorporated by an aspiring Bonisagus, or Lineage of Pralix researcher.
- House Guernicus has always found the Peripheral Code of the Tribunal questionable, but still legal. Clarifications for continental Guernicus are common.
- House Mercere lacks a Gifted Mercere in the region, so they may be willing to assign one there. Also, the Redcap culture is vast here, with the northern Mercer house being trained in the ways of old Irish heroes including their feats of arms; the Clesrada. 
- Given the close proximity of the fae, House Merinita is one of the houses with a vested interest in the region, and was one of the two houses that founded the region.
- The lands of Hibernia are often untamed, and while there is considerable faerie presence, that could certainly appeal to a Bjornaer Wilderist.
- House Tytalus was one of the founding Houses of the area, and likely the source of the chaotic Code. That said, they are also the source of one of the main troubles impacting the region, as Ballack is also from House Tytalus.
- The chaotic region has encouraged some foreign members of House Flambeau to try their luck in the region to better practice their battle magics. Local Flambeau buy into the guts and glory of the area.
- House ex Misc Traditions common in the Area:
	- Hermetic Céli Dé 
	- Pharmocopoeians
	- Lineage of Pralix
### Companions
- The Fir Bolg (a magical breed of human) and Fomórach (magical giants) are the ancient races that once ruled Ireland. Unlike most races like theirs across Mythic Europe, they are quite easy to find, and have their own islands off of Ireland’s coasts. The Fir Bolg even have their own bishopric.
- Bards still command great respect in Ireland, and there are multiple bard schools and ranks of bards. They are the last of what constitutes the ancient traditions of the druids (not confined to Connacht) in the area.
- The Hedge Magicians of the Colli Tri are sequestered off in Connacht, or wander around Ireland with less protections. Despite mostly not liking the Order, some may be off doing their own things.
- The occupation of the English lords puts a great deal of pressure on their Irish noble neighbors. Either of these groups could be excellent choices.
- The Tuatha Dé Danann and their faerie brethren are common in the Tribunal, and those with their blood lines are equally common.
### Covenant Ideas
- Though technically situated in what the Colli Tri claim to be their lands, there is a waterfall in West Breifne called the Glencar Waterfall. It is the center of a powerful magical aura, and its waters produce spell-like Vis which can heal and cleanse wounds. Young Magi of the area may care little enough about the treaty with the hedge magicians to settle here anyway.
- Near Kells is a woodland clearing with an ancient cemetery and an 80-foot-tall round tower with an open top. It is said that High King Niall mac Aeda may be buried here. Technically the land is owned by the abbey in Kells, but with the abbot’s permission it may be a possible location for a Covenant.
- The Hill of Uisneach is the mystical center of Ireland where all five provinces meet at the Stone of Division. The Stone acts as an Arcane Connection to all five provinces, and it may be possible if one is gutsy enough to cast a spell to affect the entire island. Numerous Tuatha de Dannan sleep beneath the Sídh (Faerie mound), and this is a common place to draft treaties and take oaths in the Tribunal. There used to be a Covenant, which vanished early in the local Order’s history, but it's inevitable a new Covenant will spring up here at some point.
- The largest town in Kerry, Tralee has a trail that leads into the nearby mountains, and past Scota’s grave. Scota was an Egyptian sorceress that came to Ireland to avenge the death of her sons. She did manage this, but was instead slain by Munster faeries. The grove around her burial site has a strong magic aura.
- An Bheitheach Mhór, or the Place of Birch Trees, is situated in the middle of a peat bog. Within it are numerous stone circles, cairns, and 10 straight stone lines. Every stone circle and each line has its own magical aura, with each line having an aligned aura to one of the Hermetic forms. It’s theorized that this is because of a Regio that has been shattered in the region.
