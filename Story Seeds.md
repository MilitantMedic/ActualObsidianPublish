## Faerie
Goibhniu brews a magical ale that grants immortality, and many treasure seekers have looked for Goibhniu’s hidden alehouse on an island off the Munster coast. One successful group steals the formula and produces several barrels of ale, which they then sell to neighboring princes and knights. Unfortunately, without Goibhniu brewing the ale, it turns to deadly poison within the month. A local hedge wizard knows this dire fact and asks the magi for help tracking down the barrels  
For example, the smith-god Goibhniu hates the death-god Donn. The latter steals the former’s magical cow and hides him in the local king’s ráth. Arming a band of trooping faeries (see later) with enchanted spears, Goibhniu raids the ráth, and the king asks the magi for help. A good feud story should include a way to defuse the feud, at least for the time being

Lugh the Long-Armed raids the Fomóir, just as he did thousands of years ago. Armed with magic spears created by the triad mother-goddess, he gathers young men and sails to the Fomóir islands. The magi hear that several of the macgnímartha have joined with an upcoming raid. Fearful that the Fomóir are already mounting an invasion, and that this raid will trigger a large scale advance, the magi must stop Lugh and his group. 

The war-goddess Badhbh lives on battlefields, both those littered with corpses and sites that soon will be. Seeing her is an evil omen. Poets swear that the English knight Strongbow saw the goddess bathing severed heads in a river as he rode to his last battle. A learned physician sees Badhbh on his way to cure his king, and rushes to the Covenant to ask for help. If they don’t intervene, he says, it must mean that the king will die. Can the magi chase Badhbh away?

There is a silent presence that haunts the road outside the village of Northwych and it has dark designs on those it watches come and go. How long until the silent threat is discovered? Who will save old mother Mattie from unjustly being hanged for a crime she did not commit? And will the magi be willing to destroy the killer when they discover that vis may be at stake? This story introduces the village of Northwych, a  site  of supernatural evil, and a group of faeries whose prescience could be useful if only their foul manners can be overcome. The Covenant has the chance to make firm friends or steadfast enemies in the village of Northwych but more importantly they have the chance to save an innocent. (Sub Rosa 3)

The Green Knight may be a good sovereign for a local faerie forest. He wants people to share what they gain while in his land, and he will also share what he gains while they’re there. There may be options to gain basically anything from him. People missing body parts, Gifted people missing part of their gifts, regular riches and anything else possible. On the other hand, him requiring that the PCs must share what they gain could be problematic. What happens when the Magus gains Vis, or even experience?
## Magic
Deep in the western expanses of the wilderness, roughly three day’s march from the Covenant or comfortable inn where the characters are located, is the lair of a forest-drake. Most drakes, being related to dragons, are ferocious and brutally territorial, and create lairs for themselves in areas that are rich in resources ripe for the taking: gold and other precious metals, vis, or even food. This particular drake, who calls himself Thangdrimm, has come to the area for quite a different reason. He is preparing for his own death, having lived now, for nearly three centuries. (Sub Rosa 4)

 The King has been poisoned, and only the power of a unicorn's horn can restore him to health. Guy de Turrene, a man who has dedicated his life to hunting fantastic beasts, has been dispatched to find the unicorn and bring its horn to the aid of the King. But the king‘s chief rival, the Duke, waits in the wings for the inevitable. (Giant included! Sub Rosa 6)

Had the magi never wondered at the fine and fair weather their Covenant enjoyed, or the fertility of their fields? Now that the body in the bog has been disturbed, they are about to discover the uncomfortable truth behind their good fortune.
This story is designed with a young Covenant in mind, one that is only just starting to explore the area around them. It is nominally set in Hibernia, but the events can be transported to any Tribunal where preserved bog-bodies are likely to be found. (Sub Rosa 15)

Athanasius is a Magic Human who lives in the Lost Library of Kos, in the Magic Realm. Perhaps the Covenant might have access to the Magic Realm. Alternatively if any of the Magi know of the Art of Memory, they might find a new door in their mind palace, leading to the Library. There is also the direct option of going to Kos and finding the Asklepion. (Peripheral Code 1)
Potential story seeds are:
- A book has appeared in the library, there is a mark on the inner page, that it belongs to the library of Kos.
- A botch leads to a Magus spending their time in twilight in the library.
- In the library, Athanasius’ love’s pages are found, Athanasius decides to follow the trail, which leads to the player’s Covenant.

A higher ranking Magus of the Covenant wants a look at the most recent Bonisagus Folio. They’ve entrusted the Magi to deliver it. Options include: asking nicely, trading, doing a favour, indebting themselves, or more immoral means.

The local Verditius Mage is convinced that the information required to unlock a secret of (insert mystery here) is located nearby. Moreover they’ve finally traced it down. Unfortunately, they’ve committed to a meeting with a very important client, and so can’t go fetch the thing themselves. That’s where the player Magi come in.
## Order Wide
The Houses of Verditus and Bonisagus are co-sponsoring a Grand Tribunal resolution to tax all Covenants a pawn of vis a year. This is to be given to a research team to perfect a new type of magical device. House Tremere is in favour of establishing the right of the Grand

## Hedge Wizards
 The theme of this story is revenge.  Characters are confronted with the way revenge obsesses men to their  demise, never allowing them any rest,  even when that revenge has been  satisfied.  
 Carel of Miglos is burning with  hatred for his brother the baron, who  sent him to crusade more than fifteen  years ago. He only dreams of taking  revenge from him and usurping his title in retaliation. Herios, the hedge magician, bears a grudge against the magi of Hermes who mocked him, humiliated who formerly doubted his sorcerous skills before  refusing to admit him into their   Order. Évrard d’Ange himself might   succumb to wrath and seek to avenge   the death of his beloved, while other  characters retaliate on the mercenaries  who mistreated them… (SR 14)
