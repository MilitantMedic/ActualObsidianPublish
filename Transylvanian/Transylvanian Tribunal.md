An area directly north of Macedonia and bordering the Black Sea, the region is prone to sweeping plains and wide plateaus, and contains a variety of peoples. Ultimately, the Tribunal is the home and under control of House Tremere.
## Why would I want to play in the Transylvanian Tribunal?
- You want to be much more forthright in your dealings with mundanes than in any other Tribunal.
- You want to play in a Covenant with a defined, specialized task without having to worry about all the little things like getting Vis, or protecting yourself.
- You want to deal with a lot of strange and powerful creatures.
- You enjoy order in all things.
- You love House Tremere.  
## Vis Level
Mid
The Transylvanian Tribunal has a number of ancient Roman ruins, ancient Pagan sites, and a number of odd creatures. The Tribunal is also quick to provide direct support in terms of magic resources to various Oppida. Most Vis sources are harvested by quick Tremere hands however. You’ll get as much Vis as they think you’ll need.
## State of Hermetic Politics
The Transylvanian Tribunal is incredibly politically stable, and this is because it is forced to be so. House Tremere makes their home base here, and they command and direct the entire Tribunal. There is little in the way of jockeying for power, it is simply how the Tremere Praeco or Primus directs it, along with their sub heads of the House. This is meant to show the Order what a well-run Tribunal should look like. Of course, most of the outside Order hardly agrees.
Opinions of Tribunal members are taken into account, but ultimately the decisions come from the top.

## State of Mundane Politics
The Tribunal is split into a few major ethnic groups that rule over their own areas of the Tribunal.
- Hungarians - Ruled over by King Andrew, the King is attempting a number of new institutions to improve his kingdom. However, most of them are ill advised and are starting to annoy those under him. They are also seeming to weaken his county system.
- Bulgarians - The Bulgarian Empire has attempted to take some land or at least challenge the situation in the Southern Byzantine Empire. In 1205 they captured the Emperor of the Latin Empire of Constantinople, Baldwin, and trapped him in their capital. Baldwin was killed there when he tried to seduce the Bulgarian Emperor’s wife.
- The Slavs - Split between Serbia, Bosnia, and Croatia to some extent, and there is a lot of competition between the Roman Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church here. Bosnia and Croatia are vassals to the Kingdom of Hungary.
- The Teutonic Knights - King Andrew of Hungary has given the Order of Saxon knights some land to work within the Hungarian kingdom, and the knights have brought over numerous Saxons to work their land. Most of the Barons and Counts have not appreciated this.
There are numerous other cultures in the area such as the Cumans and the Vlachs.
## New Oppida Setup Requirements
In Transylvania Covenants are not locations. Rather there are 5 Covenants, the membership of which allows certain rights, and has certain requirements. The actual physical sites are called Oppida. Oppida must have Tremere and non Tremere residents, and often have members from different Covenants.
There isn’t really a path to set up a new Oppida beyond being directed to form one for some purpose.
## Hermetic Culture
- Thanks to the Sundering, an event that caused House Tremere to be subjected to a severe punishment by the Order, the Transylvanian Tribunal is restricted to 5 Covenants. To get around this, the Covenants in the Tribunal are effectively types of Citizenship, and what would act as Covenants elsewhere are called Oppida, or Camps. These camps have highly specific purposes. No outside force has cared to correct this loophole.
- Wizard War is almost nonexistent in the Tribunal, Certamen taking its place, by pressure from. That said, the Tribunal encourages the use of mediation over doing this. Certamen can still be challenged recreationally of course “For Love”.
- House Tremere is fond of Redcaps, but they believe their role can expand considerably, and there is a considerable amount more Redcaps in this Tribunal than in any other single one. They also include traveling play troupes spreading choice stories to the populace, more direct operatives, and even some of the Magi’s spouses. House Mercere does not recognize these Redcaps for political reasons, and only recognizes the leaders of these Redcap families as true Redcaps.
- The Tremere keep a book called the Book of Legacies which contains a list of every item, mundane or magical, controlled by the House. This book is fiercely guarded. Less guarded is the Book of Placements, which takes codes from the first book for these items’ locations.
- There is a series of free wilderness hospitals/caches called Zenodochia which are free to Magi. They have a number of powerful magical items and resources to help heal a Magus far away from civilization or another Oppida. The Magi using them are expected to restock them if possible, but they are intended for the local Magi to use.
## Local Flavour & Trivia
- The Tremere have a large Roman-style villa as an “Estate of the Wizards” in the Hungarian capital maintained by House Mercere. Local nobility know it and, if they have complaints against Magi, those charges are mediated here.
- In the 11th century, the King of Hungary declared there could be no witch burnings, as witches do not exist. Thus, Magi are not witches.
- The Madara Plateau has the relief of a massive horseman thrusting his spear into the body of a lion beneath his horse’s feet. It is believed to have been a figure in the old Bulgar religion. It may be possible to use an old rite to reawaken the Horseman or perhaps enter a Regio, as a Faerie aura exists here.
- There is a dualistic religion in the Bulgarian empire and surrounding areas called the Bogomils. They believe that the universe is at constant war between Michael and Satanael, and they hold that anything that is socially created comes not from God but from Satan, thus they do not pay taxes, work as serfs, or enlist in armies. In many ways these beliefs parallel that of the Cathars in Provençal
- In the lands of the Szekler people, the giants have a king. Every time a new king is crowned, they build a new mystical palace. The remnants of these old palaces can be found across the land.
- Vampires are fairly common in the region, and in numerous forms. There is also a great amount of Dhampir, people sired by Vampires, in the region. The Tremere often employ Dhampir, but they won’t train Gifted Dhampir - it has never gone well.
- Eons ago in Roman days, a dragon named Fetillusclaviceps around Rome noticed how Roman legionaries behaved towards their leaders, and he enjoyed watching them. After following them to Transylvania, he noticed how the local infernal (Azdaja) and magical (Zmaj) dragons warred and ravaged the landscape; he figured he could force some good old Roman hierarchy on them. With some cleverness, he cowed both of the strongest dragons of each type, and formed the Pax Draconis under his rule. For a great while this peace persisted, but the great worm has not appeared for at least 50 years, and the dragons are getting restless…
- Giants are also common faeries in the region, and are much smarter than their other counterparts. They also all have a sorceress Giant mother they obey.
- Faerie horses commonly show up to aid heroes in the region as both a mount and as an advisor. These horses are highly self aware, and have a supernatural foresight when it comes to dealing with other faeries, but will happily let a hero deal with other Realm problems.
- Searching through the Pirin Mountain range travelers can find fulgurites, natural hollow glass tubes formed from lightning strikes. Longer versions are called “Perun’s Arrows'' after a local pagan god. If hurled, they will actually turn into a lightning bolt.
- The Primus of House Tremere, Poena, has been trying to get a Hermetic Chess Tournament off the ground. She wants to open it to the entirety of the Order in two years’ time.
## Magi and Oppida Ideas
### Magi
- All Covenants require at least one Tremere, and one non Tremere, and this is Tremere’s seat of power. Members of House Tremere are likely to have a great deal of focus here.
- Redcaps are very common here, and they have a variety of different tasks than in other Tribunals. The local gifted Mercere is getting on in age, and he may soon start training an heir.
- House Guernicus legal specialists are in high demand by the Tribunal as investigators, mediators, and to work on refining the Code.
- There are a lot of wild and untamed areas that may be appealing to a Bjornaer Magus, and a lot of ways to try either a Wilderist or Harmonist approach to things.
- House Tremere always needs more specialists to make more magical items, and may be willing to bring in more Verditius (or Rusticani perhaps) craftsmen to accomplish it.
- There are a couple Criamon who live here who do in fact not live as normal Criamon do, instead following the Path of Strife.
- Those of House Flambeau that see themselves more as soldiers and less as knights might find a place in the very “action ready” region.
- House ex Misc Traditions common in the Area:
	- Cult of Orpheus
	- Beast Masters
	- Taltós
	- Pharmocopoeians
### Companions
- As mentioned, some Dhampir are servants to the Tremere, and they use them for a variety of reasons.
- House Tremere employs and trains a type of Gifted and non Gifted tradition of monster slayers.
- The Teutonic Knights aren’t that welcome in the region, but perhaps a few split off.
- A number of Hungarian counts are getting quite fed up with the throne.
- In a few years, the Mongol army will hit the easternmost reaches.
- There is a massive amount of dragons, in the region, and having draconic blood is feasible.
### Oppida ideas
- Kal Valley and Lake Balaton - In folklore, it is remarked as being perhaps the most boring place on Earth. There is also a major route from the west going through here, so constant traffic. Also, it is fabled that the tomb of Attila the Hun is somewhere nearby.
- The Sunken City - There is a sunken Roman city in the Black Sea. It was rumored to be connected with their astronomers and mysteries. It has easy access to the Eastern Non-hermetic lands, Greek lands, and the Novgorod Tribunal to the north. It is also near the Isle of Achilles, and numerous other strange islands found in the Black Sea.
- Starosel - A lost tomb temple to the Thracian earth goddess Bendis. A large mound, with a few rooms inside. It is inhabited by a powerful magical spirit resistant to change. However, if the players can either subjugate or appease the spirit, this would be an incredible place of power.
Note in all these locations, any Oppida would require a singular purpose for its construction and for the Magi to act in.
