The region consists of “The Cradle and the Crescent”. In other words, the lands of the Islamic world, the fertile crescent and the centres of Islam at Baghdad, and Mecca, and even further into Persia. This is a large region, with plenty of opportunities for open minded Magi, who’re not scared of going their own way. Notably, it does not include the Levant.
## Why would I want to play in the Cradle and Crescent region
- You want to explore the intersection between the Muslim, Christian and Jewish worlds.
- You want to be on the frontlines of Hermetic expansion, free from oversight, but also aid.
- You want to deal with the Order of Suleiman, the equivalent of the Order of Hermes, consisting of Sahirs (spirit summoners). This might be through diplomacy, intrigue, or war.
- You want to experience (or struggle against) the Mongol conquests.
## Vis Level
High - The existence and interaction with the supernatural is higher here (generally) than in Europe. Sultans and Emirs have learned sorcerers studying the stars, and assisting them. Since there are no other Hermetic Magi, there is (probably) less jockeying for vis. 
## State of Hermetic Politics
There is no Hermetic presence in the Region. The closest would be the Magi in the Levant.
## State of Mundane Politics
The Mongols are arriving in the east, from the north. Many large cities will be sacked and effectively destroyed.
### Arabia
A disparate grouping of tribes who theoretically owe allegiance to the Caliph in Baghdad. Arabia is the heartland of Islam, home to the two holy cities of Mecca and Medina. Muslims are encouraged to visit this region at some point during their lives to fulfill the obligation of the hajj, the greater pilgrimage to Mecca, though for many practical concerns make this impossible. Ancient cities lie buried beneath the sands of Arabia, holy shrines are scattered across its landscape, and jinn and other supernatural creatures haunt deserted ruins and even mix with the inhabitants of some of its cities.

### Mesopotamia
Mesopotamia is the political center and northwest provinces of the Sunni Muslim world. Most of the rulers of which proclaim at least nominal allegiance to the ‘Abbasid caliph in Baghdad. However, in most areas provincial governors reign as independent rulers, only seeking approval from the caliph when it helps to bolster their claims to legitimacy. The terrain of this region is divided broadly into three zones:

In Iraq and much of the Jazira, especially between the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers, are fertile plains where agriculture flourishes; in Iraq, in particular, many of these plains benefit from being irrigated by a network of canals thousands of years old, though recent geo- logical changes, combined with the little effort made by the government to address the effects of these or maintain the existing network, have sharply reduced their productivity.

To the north, east, and northwest of these plains, the terrain becomes more mountainous, making cultivation more difficult, although valleys provide areas where crops may be grown.

Meanwhile, to the west lies the great Syrian desert that divides Mesopotamia from Syria and the Holy Land; this desert also merges to the south with the Nefud of Arabia.

Most of the inhabitants of these regions are Muslims, although there are also significant populations of Christians and Jews. The majority of people live in the cities, towns, and villages that cover the area, but the desert areas are home to a mix of wandering nomads and settled communities at oases.

Persia is ethnically and culturally diverse. Seven tenths of the land is desert and wasteland. Much of the country is on high plateaus, some 4000 to 5000 feet above sea level, with exception for the area around the Persian Gulf, and the Bahr Khazar. A significant minority of the population is nomadic or semi-nomadic; principally the Lurs of the Zagros mountains and the Ghuzz of Khurasan. Most of the provinces are ruled by a dynasty of Seljuk Turks who have sworn loyalty to the current Shah of Khwarazm; these rulers are either atabegs or mamluks. The atabegs are semi-autonomous princes, and the mamluks are raised as slave soldiers, who are placed in control of territories as direct subjects of the Shah. Two years ago the Shah met with diplomats from Genghis Khan. The Shah had them shaved and killed, a great insult, and sent back to the Khan. As yet, there has been no reaction to this.

### The Silk Road
The fabled route to distant Serica, the land of silk, is beginning to coalesce again at the beginning of the 13th century, as the Mongol invasion paradoxically creates a degree of safety for traveling mer- chants and missionaries by controlling the almost incessant brigandage of the area. Later to become known as the Silk Road, the route has existed throughout antiquity in various states of accessibility. It consists of not one road but many — a network of caravan stages, marked by resting places known as caravanserais, that branches and reforms through the deserts, steppes and mountains as the caravans travel northeastward from Baghdad. Through Khurasan and into the Eastern Provinces of Transoxiana, Badakhshan, and Wakhan, the trade routes delve past the borders of Mythic Middle East and maybe even into the supernatural Realms beyond.

## New Covenant Setup Requirements
None. Perhaps one could gain the patronage of a Covenant of the Levant, Thebes or Rome, to form a chapter house.
## Hermetic Culture
There is no Hermetic presence in the region.
## Local Flavour & Trivia
- Arabia
	- The Empty Quarter in the center of the Arabian peninsula is a giant desert, an inhospitable wasteland. It is said to swallow any traveller foolish enough to attempt to pass through. The last confirmed crossing happened in the 3rd century.
	- Hajar is the most important city in Bahrayn, being its major port and a link between Bahrayn and the coast of Persia on the opposite side of the gulf. However, its inhabitants do not go outside at night, for it bears the marks of a past trauma. It is haunted by the ghosts of the dead, who come out at night and beseech anyone they meet to help them against their persecutors, at least until they are slain by weapons wielded by invisible soldiers.
	- Mecca and Medina are the holiest cities in Islam. Non-believers may not approach nearer than 5 miles outside the city. All capable muslims are expected to make the pilgrimage (Hajj) to Mecca at least once in their lives. In Mecca stands the Ka’ba, the holiest place in Islam.
	- Myrrh and Frankincense grow mainly in the province of Hadramawt, though groves can also be found in Ethiopia, Oman, and on the isolated island of Soqotra. The trees are protected by flying serpents.
	- Arabia is ruled by many local dynasties, who owe nominal allegiance to the Caliph at Baghdad, but who in practice govern themselves. The Bedouin families still roam the deserts, trading great wealth between towns.
- Mesopotamia
	- Every summer, many of the streets and most of the open land on the south side of Baghdad fills with stalls and tents in an enormous fair. This event is well-attended by merchants and travelers from all over the Mythic Middle East, and typically lasts most of the season. It is said that all manner of goods and services may be found at this event, including unique items and entertainments brought by strange men from fantastic lands. Visitors are cautioned to maintain a clear idea of what they seek before they go exploring, for there are said to be many vendors who appear only when their wares are especially desired, or who lure unwary travelers into their tents where they disappear forever.
	- Basra is well-known for its library, which reputedly contains over 15,000 books.
	- Harut and Marut, the angels who taught magic to humans and now hang bound beneath the ruined city of Babylon. Babylon also contains the remnants of the Tower of Babel.
	- The population of Azarbayjan is incredibly diverse. Ethnically, it includes Turkic peoples, Persians, and people from the Caucasus, while its religious tapestry includes a broad mix of Muslims, Chris- tians, Jews, Zoroastrians, and followers of other religions. As a result of its terrain, communities are very scattered and its ma- jor centers are little more than large towns.
	- The province of Gilan is a relative backwater in the Muslim world, not being particularly rich or famous. Most of it is mountainous and covered with jungle, but the coastal plain is fertile, and the people who live here grow various crops including rice and wheat. The Emir has been forced into an alliance with the Nizari Isma’ili.
	- In Mukan the city of Bajarvan is a modest settlement, but enjoys fame through proximity to the Waters of Life, which are said to lie close to the town. In Arran, the city of Baylaqan also claims to be near the Waters of Life. No one has returned from their quest to find it.
	- The Abbasid Caliphs have ruled since the 8th century, though as figureheads for the 10th 11th and 12th century. They are now gaining in power.
- Persia
	- In Fars Kajaran is a small but prosperous town near the Persian Gulf. Endemic to the region is a type of magical worm that grants skill and luck to those that possess it. The fortune it grants is proportional to its size, but the Kajarani are careful not to allow the worm to grow too big.
	- In Fars the mountainous region around Yazd became the stronghold of Zoroastrianism after the coming of Islam to Persia, and remains one of the few regions where the Mazdean faith is still practiced openly. The mountains around Yazd contain six holy shrines, or pirs, which form the destinations for yearly communal pilgrimages for the Zoroastrian villages, and an excuse for feasting and dancing.
	- Isfahan, in Jibal is a twinned city: to the east is Jay, surrounded by a wall with a hundred towers, and to the west is Al-Yahudiyah, the “town of the Jews,” who have dwelt here since the time of Nebuchadnezzar. The noted physician Ibn Sina (known as Avicenna in the West) lived and taught here. Isfahan exports silk and cotton, as well as saffron and all kinds of fruit, but it is for its carpets — the famed Persian rug — that Isfahan is best known. Some of them allow one to fly.
	- The Gedrosian Desert contains an incredibly large number of pagan ghosts, soldiers from the armies that have died since antiquity attempting to cross its arid expanse; Cyrus’, Queen Semiramis, and Alexander the Great. As restless dead, these spirits are readily susceptible to the summons of necromancers and other summoners, although most are overwhelmed with the emotions of despair and memories of deprivation and are unable to provide much useful information about their past.
	- An important oasis-city on the Silk Road, Merv, in Khurasan has been named “the rendezvous of the great and the small” as a testament to its immense market, where, if accounts are true, it is possible to buy anything. The libraries of Merv are greatly celebrated. The Great Mosque has two: the ‘Aziziyah, with over 12,000 books; and the Kamaliyah library, with slightly fewer. Also stored here are the libraries of the colleges of Samanidiyah, ‘Umaydiyah, and Khatuniya. The Dumayriyah library is perhaps one of the smallest, but many of its 200 books are unique, and all are priceless. Of most interest to the Suhhar Sulayman, the library of the grand vizier Nizam al-Mulk is part of the greater collection of Merv, and its House of Wisdom is the keeper of these great tomes of magic.
	- There are 6 main supernatural factions active in Persia:
		- The Order of Suleiman.
		- The Yatus, Faerie wizards, most of whom have joined the Order of Suleiman.
		- The Mobeds, holy Zoroastrian priests.
		- The Nizari Isma’ili.
		- Zahhak, a demonic spirit who returns again and again.
		- The Ghuzz, a race of magic blooded giants, who breed horses the size of elephants.
- In Persia, the remnants of Zoroastrianism still hang on. They’re considered Dhimmi, people of the book, who, in exchange for a tax (Jizya) are allowed to freely practise their religion, and govern themselves. This freedom in exchange for a tax also applies to Christians and Jews in the islamic world.
- The Isma’ili state is unlike others in the Mythic Middle East, in that it does not exist on maps, or in terms of military might, but rather lies in the hearts of men. It is a small state and widely scattered, nevertheless it is united under a strong devotion to its beliefs and goals, and has successfully resisted all threats aimed against it since its foundation over a hundred years ago. The Nizaris exercise political dominance in Persia, not through their meager territorial successes but through the point of a knife and through magical murder. Rather than meeting their enemies in battle they use subterfuge and deception to eliminate the leaders. (These are the mythical Assassin of the Muslim world)
- The Silk Road
	- Bukhara lies under siege by Genghis Khan’s army. It is feared the city will soon fall.
	- The limestone deposits along the Badakhshan River at Lahzvard are the only source of lapis lazuli known in Mythic Europe. From here, strongly guarded shipments of lapis lazuli travel west to supply European artists and Magi or are sent east into the fabled lands of Hind, Serica, and perhaps even the adjoining mountainous regions of Faerie.
	- The Mongols are a looming threat to the north of Mesopotamia and Persia. Canonically (Meaning, if the world continues as it would without character influence) they take the entirety of eastern Persia by 1227, and western Persia, Georgia, Armenia and northern Iraq by 1240. Finally by 1260 they’ve made it all the way to Syria (sacking or damaging most cities in their path) and are only turned back by the Mamluk (freed slave soldiers) state.
## Character and Covenant Ideas
### Magi
- A Bonisagus (or other) Magus may be interested in learning in one of the Houses of Wisdom, studying alongside the Sahirs.
- Magi Trianomae might be interested in politicking with the Order of Suleiman.
- Jerbiton Magi may be interested to see what forms of beauty might be found so far from home.
- Magi Trianomae Seekers would be interested in some of the ancient sites that dot the landscape.
- Ahead of a proper expansion (if that happens) into the region, setting up a network for Redcaps to use is paramount.
- If more Covenants are settled then there must be a basic peripheral code set up. A job for a Quaesitor.
- There are no House ex Misc Traditions common in the Area, but these could develop:
- Hermetic Sahir - The Order of Suleiman’s brothers, who split off from them in the 10th century. While there are great differences between them, some of the Hermetic Sahirs might want to reestablish contact with the Order of Suleiman.
- Lineage of Pralix - As always this lineage has a focus of integrating new traditions into the Order. There are many exotic traditions to integrate.
- Local ones (once integrated) such as the Mobeds, or perhaps even Mongol magicians (if diplomacy goes the right way).
### Companions
- A strongly Jinn blooded companion might be ostracised by their family and community.
- A holy man from a Zoroastrian community might be convinced to bring his people and settle at the Covenant, in exchange for being promised freedom of religion, without a tax.
- A repentant Nizari assassin might seek solitude and peace, after many years of war.
- Some priests might be interested in trying to find Prester John’s mythical kingdom. It is speculated that it might either be around Hindustan.
- As the Mongol invasion passes, there will be dispossessed peoples. Many Nobles might be without a place to call their own, having fled for their lives. The same applies to other, regular, people.
- The Mongol Horde might also bring options for characters. One could imagine a Mongol Diplomat, assigned to the Covenant. Or a strong warrior, who fell on the battlefield but was rescued by the Covenant.
### Example Covenant Sites
- Ma’rib, in Yemen, the ancient capital of The Queen of Sheba. Once ruled by royal priests worshipping deities of the sun, the moon, and the stars. Most of the area lies in ruin, but the great Jinn temple Ghumdam remains. Water elementals predate on the people in the area, after the grand dyke was broken. There might be difficulty in supplying the site, as it is very remote.
- Ubar, in Hadramawt was once home to the giants of ‘Ad. Idolaters, they refused a prophet from god, and in rage, their city was buried under the sands. There is a great depression over the city, which might be a good place for a Covenant, as it has a magical aura. The city underneath may have ancient riches.
- Samarra, in Iraq used to be the capital of the Caliphate, but after it moved to Baghdad the city was partly abandoned. Now most of the buildings lie in ruin, with the notable exception of the Great Mosque of al-Mutawakkil, and surroundings. These days the majority of the population are Twelver Shi’is. A potential problem with setting up a Covenant is what the mundane population would think of it.
- Lake Urmiya in Azerbayjan is inhabited by fishermen who catch strange dog headed fish who live in the lake. There is a ruined tower, in which a sorceress used to live. It is said that she was the ultimate creator of the fish. Underneath the tower are catacombs.
- An isolated site in mountainous Armenia. Unsettled by mundanes, there are many sites which have never seen anyone step foot in them. There are likely to be areas of high magical aura.
- In the southeastern corner of the Aral sea lies a small island, called Jabal Jaghrahaz. The water surrounding the island is perpetually frozen — local folk swear it must be the dwelling of powerful water jinn, the marid Jaghrahaz, but none are brave enough to venture across the frozen water to investigate the small hill that the island contains.
- The Ruins at Ai Khanoum consists of partial remains of several structures, including a gymnasium, a theater almost the size of the great structure at Epidauros, and several temples to pagan Greek gods, most notably Zeus and Dionysius. There is a pillar in the centre of the gymnasium dedicated to Hermes and Hercules.
- The Sogdian rock is a mountain pockmarked with caves. Only a few local tribesmen know the location. It is said that the ghosts of 30 of Alexander’s soldiers haunt the rock, tormenting any Persians they meet.
- The Bam-i-Dunya, or “Roof of the World,” refers to the high plateaus of the Pamir knot, the northwestern Caucasus Indicus, and the ranges that extend southward and eastward. In classical texts, the crests of this region are the lesser flanks of Mount Imeon, the mountain at the center of the world, considered by some Criamon Magi as the possible original location of the Axis Magica prior to Criamon’s ascendance into Twilight. Beware the Ruq.
