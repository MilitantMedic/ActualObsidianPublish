Covering the area of Egypt, Nubia, Ethiopia and surrounding areas. Unlike the areas above, The Nile Region is not a Tribunal, but it could become one. It is full of ancient tombs, relics, and a diverse region of peoples. That said, it is currently devoid of Hermetic presence, and you could be the first.
NOTE: There are themes of Slavery in this area that are hard to ignore.
## Why would I want to play in the Nile Region?
- You want to explore ancient ruins and magical traditions, and raid them for the glory of the Order.    
- You want to deal with a complex region culturally, with a variety of different peoples and states within it. 
- You want to play beyond the edges of the Order of Hermes, and perhaps work to establish your own Tribunal.
- You want to deal with the Crusades, in one way or the other, which are active in the North of the Tribunal.
## Vis Level
Mid - High (Leaning High)
Egypt has more magical tombs than its history can seemingly afford, so much that there is legitimate business in raiding them. There is a vast scale of good (The Black) versus evil (The Red) being played out unwittingly between the deterioration of the desert and the life-giving of the Nile. There is a cult of Undead Magicians that have achieved a false form of eternal life. Fairies still attempt to ape the old ways.
## State of Hermetic Politics
By default, there is none. There might be options to deal with Covenants in Thebes, the Levant, or perhaps a mobile Covenant.
## State of Mundane Politics

### Egypt
The Ayyubid Sultan of Egypt is fighting against the Fifth Crusade, which has taken the city of Damietta. The Crusade now awaits the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II, who will surely come with enough fresh soldiers to allow them to attack the capital, Cairo. The Sultanate rules over a Muslim majority and a significant Coptic Christian minority, who were the original denizens of Egypt before it was conquered. The Sultan seems to have a divinely inspired level of wealth, which he is mostly spending on rebuilding Alexandria at the moment. The leader of all the Coptic Church resides in Alexandria, and the Nubian and Ethiopian Churches look towards them. Unfortunately for them, this means they need the Sultans' approval as well to appoint bishops and for other needs.

### Nubia
Nubia is a series of kingdoms that are primarily Christian, which formed out of the old Empire of Kush. They are under an agreement with Egypt called the Baqt that requires them to pay a certain amount of slaves every three years in return for no forced conversion to Islam and no invasions. The Nubian kingdoms primarily “acquire” these people (as does Egypt) from an area they refer to as The Slavelands (this is not the region’s name for itself. It’s the Nubian term for it to lessen the blow of raiding it). There are three kingdoms within; Alodia, Makuria, and Nobatia. Nobatia has been a client state of Makuria for 400 years.


Notably Salah ed-Din (Saladin) invaded Nobatia in 1171. The Ayyubids occupied Nobatia’s city Premnis for years. Eventually they retreated, mainly due to concerns about the crusades, and relations were reestablished, though trust had taken a hit. These days the Baqt is paid less and less frequently, and locals from Nobatia are being relocated into fortress cities, particularly, where possible, on islands in the Nile.

Another problem is the arrival of bedouin tribes, from both Arabia and Egypt. They’ve been driven out by the Sultan, and have now established warring principalities, called meks, on the east side of the Nile. Nobatia has avoided this problem, due to their desert climate which is not suitable grazing land. On the other hand Nobatia has the Banu al-Kanz, an Islamic tribe which is settled in the North. It is semi-independent of Nobatia.

### Ethiopia
Ethiopia was once the Axumite Empire, and is currently a primarily Christian set of states ruled over by the Ethiopian emperor, with a Jewish minority (called the Falasha) who are well treated and live peacefully alongside their neighbors. The emperor rules over Agaw, Behri Madi, Bet Amhara, and Shewa. Effectively everything Shewa and Northward, except Dahlak which is a tributary. To the south are tributary states consisting of the small Muslim Sultanates of Adal, Ifat, Dewaro, and Hadiya. The Ethiopians claim a connection to Solomon and Israel via their Queen of Sheba, Makkeda.

## New Covenant Setup Requirements
None. Perhaps one could gain the patronage of a Covenant of the Levant, Thebes or Rome, to form a chapter house.
## Hermetic Culture
None. That’s for you to establish.
## Local Flavour & Trivia
- Egypt
	- There are so many ancient tombs and temples in Egypt that it is an industry to raid them. There is even an official Seekers’ Guild that can help show you the way, but of course they expect to take a cut. These Tombs have magical and mundane treasures, and can be incredibly dangerous, and profitable.
	- There is currently no Patriarch of the Coptic Church, though there is a frontrunner: Cyril ibn Laqlaq has immense money and influence, but there is a strong faction resisting his election. Meanwhile, there is no head, and the local Church is without someone to appoint Bishops. A dangerous thing.
	- Egypt as a whole has the Iqta’ system; a system where the Sultan divides his land up to be given to his powerful supporters, through a series of contracts. These contracts give the owner the right to produce in the territory, in exchange for military service, and a tax. Notably this contract is not hereditary, and it is usual for the next generation to be given a different parcel of land. This is to prevent local nobility from becoming too entrenched. This can cause trouble with prospective Covenants, as having a “tame nobleman” doesn’t last longer than a generation.
	- In Cairo stands the Maristans, one of the greatest (group of) hospitals in the world. One building is for men, another for women, and a third for the insane. Funded by the Sultan, the hospital includes bathhouses, an excellent library, and free lectures where the interested can learn medicine.
	- The City of Alexandria pays (almost) no taxes, and is awash in the Sultan’s seemingly limitless funds. It currently has more Mosques than anywhere else in the world, and the city receives 2000 loaves of bread per day to give out to its citizens.
	- It is generally believed that God put all these monuments in Egypt so that people would look at them and become wiser. There are more tombs than historically possible because God has made the lands of the Nile as a storehouse of wonders.
	- Most ghosts of Ancient Egyptians maintain their own tombs. They fight off tomb robbers, and may take those tomb robbers they have killed, and use their ghosts to help fight back against intruders.
	- Sugar Cane has just taken root as a new crop in Egypt. While this would become huge in time, it is a relatively new crop currently. Rumors abound about the origin of the crop. Is it gifted by God or a demon’s trickery?
	- House Jerbiton sometimes runs its Itinerarium (extended cultural holiday for apprentices) for about-to-be gauntleted apprentices through the region. Having some secure Covenants to run through may be ideal.
- Nubia
	- Nubia is overwhelmingly Christian; in Makuria and Alodian it is even illegal to convert to or profess another faith.
	- In Nubia people are so superstitious of the dead they refuse to look at a gravesite at all, if they can avoid it. The Kingdom of Alodia goes even further, not speaking of the dead by name or even their deeds if they can avoid it. There exists a Mortuary Society which deals with the dead on others behalf, but those who work there are pariahs.
	- In Nubia there is a large flat topped mountain called Dju Wa’ab. It is littered with ancient ruins and temples that are no longer in use. Faeries once lived here, but left with worship, though the magic still remains. Proper rites may call those Faeries back however.
	- Near Nubia, to the East, is a supernatural people called the Blemmyae, who are magical nomadic raiders. Blemmyae have no head, but instead a face on their chests. Their ears are under their armpits. Despite this oddity, their bodies are naturally resistant to damage. They worship the stars and Kushitic gods and speak their own language.
	- The Slavelands lie (far) to the Southwest of Alodia (past Fasher). Populated mainly by peaceful pastoralist tribes, without central organization, these people are easy targets. Owning slaves in Nubia is legal, but heavily looked down on.
	- Nobatia practises a state mandated redistribution of all excess produce every year. This greatly reduces the poverty in the region.
	- All of Makuria is forbidden to foreign traders. Traders going to Alodia take a road, instead of the Nile. 
	- The Nile is impassable at the second cataract due to the Batn al-Hajr, or belly of stones, a particularly low depth area of the Nile.
	- The Cult of Dedun is said to be a cult of an ancient God. There are rumors that the cultists perform profane rituals in grave sites, and live for longer than they should. It is also said that they squat in tombs and raise undead minions and ghosts for their purposes.
- Ethiopia
	- Off the shore of Ethiopia in the Red Sea, is the Leviathan Ceto, a powerful Faerie Dragon that attacks boats, and raids vessels. She often leaves survivors so they can continue to tell her tale.
	- The Ethiopians claim to have the real Ark of the Covenant. Whether real or not, it is a powerful relic that is important to the people of Ethiopia. 
	- They have their own calendar, the year calculated differently. They believe that Christ was born 8 years after 0 A.D. They also have different holy days.
	- The Abuna of Ethiopia is a church rank above bishop but below patriarch. He is sent from Cairo by the patriarch of Cairo. Currently Abuna Yeshaq is in office.
	- Ethiopians have 3 types of churches: A carved stone recessed square, a rectangular standing stone construction, or a round timber building. Circular timber, and standing stone churches must be surrounded by a thick sacred forest.
	- It is unknown what there is to the south of the Sultanates. Jungles abound, and supposedly the mountains of the moon, and then finally the torrid lands. Exploring this would be an epic adventure, and who knows what lies at the end of the road.
	- Many in Ethiopia believe blacksmiths to really be folk witches with the power to change into hyena beasts called bouda which sneak out at night to devour corpses.
	- The Emperor’s court in Ethiopia is mobile, and constantly travels around to keep loyalty among its citizens, though the capital is technically the town of Roha.
- There are Serpents capable of swallowing elephants whole.
- Ancient tombs may contain insights into new Mysteries and ancient magics.
- The child of a Blemmyae and a human is called a Dihi. They look human for the most part, but their ears are on the undersides of their arms like a Blemmyae. At some point in their life, they are shocked or scared by something greatly enough where their head just pops off. This does not hurt them and they can reattach them. From then on, stressful situations may cause their heads to fall off.
## Character and Covenant Ideas
### Magi
Note that by the nature of this region, all Magi settling here will likely be immigrating here. These ideas are going to be less regional for the most part, and more the type of person that’d want to establish something outside of Hermetic territory. Also note, it’s unlikely many Magi will have originated in this region.
- Magi Trianomae would be very interested in learning more about basically any ancient magic, and this place is a gold mine for Seekers.
- If the goal is to establish a new Tribunal, local Quaesitors would help both establish a new code and to help encourage foreign Magi that the code is not being broken.
- For the Order in the Region to function, setting up new routes for Redcaps would probably be essential.
- It is unlikely that House Tremere wouldn’t send at least one representative if there’s a chance of a new Tribunal opening up.
- There are many ancient secrets housed within Tombs of the Nile, and House Criamon could use the area to seek Enlightenment or perhaps discover a new Path.
- There are also numerous Faerie representatives of the old Pagan Gods that those of House Merinita may wish to make contact with.
- There are also a lot of magical objects in those tombs a Verditius Magus may want to study.
- House Jerbiton might be interested in the culture of the area. They’ve traditionally been very Europe focused (obviously) and an expansion into a different sort of court life could be intriguing.
- Magi of House Flambeau might be interested in prosecuting the Crusade. This is probably not going to cause “ruin upon my Sodales”, as there are no Sodales nearby, but might still be in violation of the Code of Hermes. But if they are in violation, who is going to stop them?
- There are no House ex Misc Traditions common in the Area, but these could develop.
	- Hermetic Sahir - Though they tend to sequester themselves to the Iberian Tribunal, that isn’t for a lack of trying to make contact with other Muslim Sahirs, though they often have a chilly or hostile response. A territory with a large Muslim presence may be appealing to some that wish to spread out.
	- Lineage of Pralix - This lineage hunts for traditions outside the order to incorporate them. A Magus of their lineage would love to dive right in.
	- Seirenes - This tradition exists along the Coastline of the Mediterranean. Spreading to the coast of Egypt isn’t unreasonable. 
### Companions
- Numerous Caravans crisscross the region for mercantile reasons. A Caravan leader would be a great source of income and information for any Covenant. 
- Within the Morticians of Kassala (in Nubia) are an order of Exorcists that deal with undead and roaming spirits, along with monstrous necromancers and their servants.
- Treasure Hunters and Adventurers exist in drovers within the region, legally or illegally, as official Seekers or Grave Robbers.
- What Nubia calls the Slavelands is full of a variety of different people that have been unjustly claimed as slaves by or for Egypt. There are numerous unique human peoples that inhabit that region.
- The Sultan has agents he commands within a grand teaching institution called The House. While they do work for the Sultan, it is possible one may be working with a Covenant for the Sultan’s purposes.
- Though they are unique people, the Blemmyae (the ones with the heads on their chests) are still human, just magical ones. One working with the Covenant is perfectly feasible.
### Example Covenant Sites
- The Oasis of Siwa - A very easily defensible location, and a pilgrimage site of Alexander the Great. The people have tended to some ancient Oracles of the God Ammon. It is a very out of the way location, the Sultan barely pays attention to, and is surrounded by desert and possible tombs. That said, being an out of the way location, it’d be difficult for a Covenant to get enough supplies, especially the more obscure ones Hermetic Magi use.
- Ikhmindi - A frontier site near the kingdom of Nobotia in Nubia situated on the shore of the Nile, the small settlement has a variety of different cultures of people that have found their way there. These people vary from escaped slaves, disparate peoples from Europe, families seeking a new life in the region, and elsewhere. The religious structures of the walled community still remain, but due to disuse, the entire walled settlement has a magic aura. This is far less isolated than Siwa, but ruins still abound. That said, so do Bedouin raiders. The Covenant location is poor in pounds flow at the moment, but that could change with effort.
- Adulis - South of the town of Adulis in Ethiopia, is a small village next to a large abandoned lighthouse on the coast of the Red Sea. This community was once destroyed by Ceto. Unlike the other two, this village is in a major trading area, and has some resources that could be exploited, so money should not be an issue, but you are also much closer to being noticed by mundane rulers of the area. While there are less ruins and tombs, you have direct access to the Red Sea, so wider exploration is possible.
