Each regional Tribunal is composed, in theory, of all the magi living in a certain area of Europe. These areas are roughly fixed by Grand Tribunal decisions, but the magi in them can change the name of the Tribunal at will, and set the membership requirements freely. In general, you don’t change Tribunals if you visit a covenant in a different Tribunal, and different Tribunals might have different rules on just how long a visit can be. Regional Tribunals meet once every seven years, and the Redcaps are required to ensure that every magus in the Tribunal has received an invitation. Otherwise, they follow the normal rules for Tribunals.

A Tribunal must have at least twelve magi from at least four covenants. There must be at least one Quaesitor present to oversee the legality of the proceedings, and while the Quaesitor does not vote, he does count towards the quorum.  

Magi may vote by proxy, giving their voting sigils to someone who is attending on their behalf, who may or may not be required to use them in a certain way, depending on the agreement with the person granting the sigil.

  The Tribunal is chaired by the Praeco, the oldest magus present, and while he also cannot vote, except to break ties, he does have the power to choose the order of business and, in extreme circumstances, silence a magus or eject him from the Tribunal. If the ejections render the Tribunal inquorate, or deprive it of the presiding Quaesitor, the Tribunal ceases to be valid. At the end of the Tribunal, the presiding Quaesitor must certify it as valid, and this is the main check on the Praeco abusing his power.
# Why would I want to Play in…
## The Greater Alps Tribunal?

## The Hibernian Tribunal?
- You want to play a unique Hermetic climate more willing to work alongside, or at least near, Hedge Traditions.
- You want to deal with a tale as old as time in Ireland; the English invading. This also includes foreign magi coming to reform the Code.
- You want to play in a Tribunal where the supernatural is significantly more obvious to the mundane population and to Magi alike.
- You want to examine the culture of both native, English, and Continental Magi.
## The Normandy Tribunal?
- You want to play out knightly romances and chivalry in the style of Arthur and Charlemagne.
- You want to have a populous mundane world surrounding your Covenant.

- You want to build on the ruins of numerous Roman cities, southern French cities, and Covenants.
- You want to deal with complications of heresy, the Church, and the Infernal.
- You want to play in the most “balanced” (or default) Tribunal; legally, politically, in mundane relations, and in magical power.
## The Rhine Tribunal?
- You want to play in the oldest, and most typical Magi experience, albeit with a strong traditionalist upper class of Magi above you, at the center and birthplace of Hermetic culture.
- You want to play with a heavily formalized society, and either work with it, or try to reform it, with a number of well established but questionable Hermetic rulings with far reaching consequences. 
- You want to deal with the dichotomy of hiding in vast wild forests, and/or trying to live with or near mundanes.
- You want your mundane world to be somewhat united, but for the most part a number of disparate powers.
- You want your location to be central not just culturally, but physically in the Hermetic world, and be at a crossroads of Hermetic culture.
## The Stonehenge Tribunal?
## The Theban Tribunal?
- You want to play in the most aggressively democratic Tribunal, with an effective bureaucracy and a system to reward and punish Magi.
- You want to play with Greek mythology, both the gods and other relevant pieces of myth.
- You want to investigate the remnants of the empires of Rome and Alexander the Great.
- You want to deal with an ongoing occupation of your home by Crusaders and Venetians.
## The Transylvanian Tribunal?
- You want to be much more forthright in your dealings with mundanes than in any other Tribunal.
- You want to play in a Covenant with a defined, specialized task without having to worry about all the little things like getting Vis, or protecting yourself.

## In Mythic Africa?
- You want to be at the edge of the world. Exploring new lands and new peoples.
- You don’t want to be tied down by worries of “Interfering with the mundanes”. Since there are no other Covenants for damage to be blown back on, nor are there strong enough mundanes to take their grievances out on Magi in a completely different tribunal (you hope).
- You want to live in a place untouched by the Church. No monasteries or abbeys to compete with you for builders, nor land.
- You want to experience the intersection between Arabs and desert nomads.
