The Byzantine Empire has been shattered by the 4th crusade, and the areas around Asia Minor and Greece have split into Latin and Venetian occupation, along with a few successor states trying to reclaim Constantinople. Foreigners from the 4th crusade are called Franks. The area has the remnants of great civilizations on top of great civilizations, and the magic and faiths that supported them. The Titans are chained or sleeping, and the presence of the Greek gods remains in the faerie.
## Why would I want to play in the Theban Tribunal?
- You want to play in the most aggressively democratic Tribunal, with an effective bureaucracy and a system to reward and punish Magi.
- You want to play with Greek mythology, both the gods and other relevant pieces of myth.
- You want to investigate the remnants of the empires of Rome and Alexander the Great.
- You want to deal with an ongoing occupation of your home by Crusaders and Venetians.
## Vis Level
High
Vis is plentiful in the Theban tribunal, and Magi often give it as gifts. Magical and Faerie beings are easy to find, and the sleeping Titans breathe power into the world. There are numerous sites of myth to visit and magic and Fae places are still untouched by the Dominion. Demons spawned from the horrors of the crusade still roam, along with monstrosities that have long walked these lands, and those with the blood of ancient heroes still spring up.
## State of Hermetic Politics
Constantinople fell 16 years ago, and the initial panic has subsided. Some believe the new political landscape will not affect the magical one, but most do not agree. Some Frankish Magi followed the Frankish crusaders, and there is some pressure from them to change the politics of the Tribunal, which the local Magi are strictly against. There are not enough of them to force the situation, however.
Every Magus has an opinion on the current situation, but not all are willing to commit to a specific course of change. Leagues, groups of Magi with specific political goals, are forming, trying to promote their own agenda.
The Tribunal consists of polites (citizen) and metoikos (resident foreigner). Most Magi by far are polites. It is possible to be “demoted” to a metoikos if one doesn’t contribute to Hermetic society.
The tribunal is divided into Phylai which are a purely geographic delineation.

## State of Mundane Politics
The Byzantine Empire has been split into various Crusader States and Byzantine Successor states. Here are some of the most significant players.
- Formed by the Greek rebellion against the Latin Empire, the Principality of Epiros is run by Theodore Dukas. It is ruthlessly expansionist and is pushing into Thessaloniki with its army of Frankish mercenaries.
- The Kingdom of Thessaloniki is run by a young Frankish king, Demetrios, and he is in his teens. It actually has fairly good relations with its Greek subjects, and maintains a primarily Byzantine force against Epiros.
- The Duchy of Athens is run by Otto de la Roche, who is a firm supporter of the Catholic Church and truly believes that Eastern Orthodoxy is a heresy. His treatment of Orthodox priests is considered so shameful the Pope excommunicated him. He has recently converted the Parthenon to a Cathedral.
- Conversely, in the Principality of Achaea next door, Geoffrey the II is very supportive of the local Orthodox Church and has been actively restricting the Catholic Church influencing the region. He is well-loved by both his Greek and Latin subjects.
- The vast majority of the islands in the Aegean sea owe fealty to the Latin Empire, and are under control of various Venetian merchants. The Venetians have vast power in the area, and control trade.
- Constantinople is under control of the Latin Empire. Last year Empress Yolanda died, and the new emperor, Robert, is en route. The Empire of Nicaea in Anatolia just reignited hostilities, and prospects do not look bright.
- Theodore Laskaris is the Emperor of Nicaea to the east, and he has been building power and resources to retake his homeland. He has storied history, and is ready to move forward with his new power base.

## New Covenant Setup Requirements
There are only a few requirements for a new Covenant.
1. Your Covenant must be dedicated to a specific role or purpose, preferably one not in use by another Covenant.
2. Your Covenant must have a magical (or faerie or divine or maybe even infernal) creature that is willing to be your patron. This creature must have might, Magi don’t count.
3. Your Covenant needs an acceptable (legal) charter.
Once this is all handled, the Conciliatory Board reviews it, and if everything is in good order the Board votes to approve, usually the vote is a formality at that point.
## Hermetic Culture
- Unlike other Tribunals, the Theban Tribunal uses Classical Greek instead of Latin as its primary Hermetic language.
- Every Tribunal, 4 Magi from each Phyle are randomly selected to sit on the magistrate council. They act as the leaders of the Tribunal for the next seven years and are assigned to various boards. No Magus can serve on the same board twice (minus the Treasury board). There are other political appointments.
- Working for the sake of the Tribunal is encouraged, and Magi are rewarded with tokens for good service (including serving on the council, finding Gifted children to deliver to Tribunal, healing other Magi, etc). These tokens can be used to gain apprentices at Tribunal, request services from other Magi, request benefits from the Tribunal, and eliminate shards on a 1 to 1 basis.
- Likewise, poor behavior is punished with a shard. Magi can neutralize their shards by gaining tokens, or arguing at Tribunal to remove them. Gain too many, and you may be voted to be ostracized, and exiled from the Tribunal.
- The Tribunal takes place at the wandering Island of Delos, and Magi traditionally do a ritual dedicated to their patron at the lake, which empowers them. Other Tribunals believe this smacks of paganism.
- The Magi of the Tribunal have the tendency to form Leagues, political entities to encourage certain changes. Here are some existent leagues.
- The League of Constantine - This league wishes to return a Greek Emperor to the throne of Constantinople. Purely through legal means, of course.
- The Children of Olympos - This league wants Magi to stop wasting time worshiping the Dominion and dealing with magical creatures, and have patrons that are more reliable and interested in human affairs: the Greek gods.
- The League of the Vigilant - It is known infernal forces were part of Constaninople’s fall, and these Magi and Redcaps suspect that it is possible that the Order may also be infected. This league is very new, and there are those that wonder about its effectiveness and consequences.
- League Against Idolatry - This league has been trying to remove the remnants of pagan practices in the Order’s traditions, working through the Peripheral code to limit it.
## Local Flavour & Trivia
- Just outside the sea of Thessaloniki, a ship may run into the Gorgona at sea, the transformed sister of Alexander the Great. She will ask the ship if Alexander still reigns.
- Mt Olympos is the tallest mountain in the region. There is a rumored Faerie Regio at the top which leads to the court of the Greek gods.
- There are infernal vampires called Vrykolakes that can spring up from the improperly buried dead. Those born on a Saturday, the Alaphroiskiotoi, tend to have special abilities to be able to fight them off. 
- On the Island of Patmos, there is a cave where St John received the apocalyptic visions from Jesus, which were later recorded in Revelations. Monks from nearby visit here to see if they receive visions. It is rumored that one can attempt to enter the Divine Regio here in the fissure depicting Armageddon.
- Every year on the anniversary of the Nika Riots on January 14th, Infernal ghosts rise from the grounds of the Constantinople Hippodrome, crying their revolutionary cry of “NIKA”. Previously they could not escape the Hippodrome thanks to the Dominion aura surrounding it, however, thanks to the crusades, those auras have receded somewhat, and they now roam the city.
- Every year, on the anniversary of the Marathon, the ghost of that runner appears in Athens, and runs to the steps of the Parthenon. If he sees that it is under Greek control, he smiles, and then fades. If not, he sighs, disappears, and the spirits of over 100 Athenian Hoplites raid the city to take it back. They do not attack Greek citizens. The Local Latin lords have to defend the city every year because of this.
- In Anatolia, near the town of Abydos, lie the ruins of the throne built for Xerxes in his conquest of Greece. It gives an entire view of the Hellespont, and unnaturally enhances the vision of anyone sitting on the throne.
- True Purple is rare, and that color is usually reserved for the Byzantine royal family, though the secret of the murex shellfish from which it is derived has spread. Things dyed true purple (also called tyrian purple) are incredibly magically sympathetic towards rulership.
- In Macedonia, men who live wicked lives turn into destructive wild boars upon death, having demons infest their corpses and harass their families before disappearing into the wilderness.
- The Island of Khios is famous for a spice called Mastic Shrub, which only grows there, and produces chewable gum.
- There is an Egyptian Pillar brought to Constaninople by the Emperor Julian the Apostate which is said to allow those that study it to try to divine the future. The pillar was damaged, and if repaired, would surely allow easier divination.
- Seven demons in the form of slavering dogs, which were once banished by St Andrew, prowl around the city of Nicea at night, hoping to butcher unguarded travelers.
## Covenant and Character Ideas
### Magi
- Trianoman Seekers have a lot of ancient lore and sites to search for in terms of Ancient magic. There is plenty of research available.
- Given how the Tribunal is structured, Guernicus Magi are often not compelled to act as Quaesitors, given the Magistrate council and other positions handle that. Instead they act as expert witnesses. They also run the Terram Cult at the Covenant of Hedyosmos.
- The Cult of Heroes within House Mercere has a vested interest in the location, as those with the Blood of Heroes seem to be more common there. A Gifted Mercere might try to find and recruit such people into becoming Redcaps.
- House Tremere has a poor reputation in the region, thanks to trying to conquer it over 300 years ago. That said, they do have a presence, primarily at the Covenant of Gigas, and wish to try to get the Tribunal more in line with the others.
- House Merinita has numerous faerie representations of the Greek gods, myths and further to devote themselves to.
- The current Primus of House Verditius resides here, albeit tradition states he should be moving to Verdi in Rome. However, he says the Domus Magna is now his Covenant, Ignasia. Most Verditius Magi are unsure of how to proceed, or where the next contest will be in 1228.
- House Jerbiton has always had a vested interest in Constantinople since its inception. During its sacking, they rushed into the city to try to save as much as possible, including Gifted children. That generation of children is called the Antigones within the house, and they are just coming of age, and many want more direct action to take back their home.
- House ex Misc Traditions common in the Area:
	- Witches of Thessaly
	- Cult of Orpheus
	- Pharmacopeians
	- Lineage of Pralix
	- Seirenes
### Companions

- The Dynatoi are (currently disenfranchised) nobles of the Byzantine Empire. Many would like their old familial positions back. Their titles are not hereditary, but usually the same families ended up being reappointed.
- Eunuchs are common as bureaucrats within the Empire.
- People with the Blood of Heroes are more common here.
- The Eastern Orthodox traditions differ heavily from Catholic ones, and they are currently under pressure by the Latin invaders. A monk or priest may have much to deal with.
- Speaking of them, both Latin Crusaders and Venetian traders are newish to the area, and the ones supposedly in charge.
- Those touched by the Greek gods and spirits are common.
- There are a few breeds of hedge magicians in the area, such as the Apostles of Apollonius, Folk Witches, and Night Walkers.
### Example Covenant Sites
- Dodona - There is a place on the western edge of the Pindos mountains which is an ancient Sanctuary. It was once a temple to the titaness Rhea, then an altar to Zeus. There was a sacred grove where the Priestesses of Rhea gained communications from her, though a local bishop chopped down the last oak in the fifth century. However, some Magi Trianomae have replanted the Oaks recently, and the magic aura returned. There is a gate in a ruined Roman amphitheater that is believed to lead to the realms of the Titans, but the Trianomae have yet to figure out how to open the way to the Regio.
	- Magical Patron - Perhaps a Titan entity?
	- Magical Patron - Rhea if the Covenant could somehow make contact
- Orphykia - There is a sacred grove on the Isle of Lesbos, where it is said that Opheus’s head was buried after he died. The site is maintained by a lone member of the Cult of Orpheus, and it is sacred to them.
    - Magical Patron - The ghost of the famous poetess Sappho still appears in gardens and places of poetry, inspiring others. She may be convinced to act as the Covenant’s patron in the grove.
- The Labyrinth of Knossos - The remains of the Labyrinth still exist on Crete. There are many twisting and turning catacombs, and while they bear a magic aura, there may be a deeper faerie aura hidden deeper within that contains the original version of the Labyrinth.
	- Magical Patron - Formerly sealed within the Labyrinth, the giant automaton and protector of Crete, Talos used to reside waiting. However, when the Venetians took over Crete, he awoke, and began circling the island thrice daily, destroying any Venetian ships he saw with giant thrown rocks and his blazing red-hot arms. The Venetians have a price on this “demon’s” head.
	- Magical Patron - The Minotaur of Knossos.
	- Magical Patron - The Cretan Bull.
- Trebizond - The town of Trebizond in Anatolia has a great deal of experimental and philosophical scholarship, and is very sympathetic to Persian and Arabic learning. Due to its natural beauty, numerous magic auras have sprung up around the area.
	- Magical Patron - A probably terrible idea for a patron, the Bardi, a local shapeshifting jackal spirit, has been harrying the people of the area.
- Ilion, or Troy - A faerie site through and through. Many Faerie Regiones have sprung up, due to the plethora of tales surrounding Troy. In 1109 a Covenant was founded there, however it went missing, buildings and all, before the next Tribunal.
	- Magical Patron - Any of the Trojan heroes, or villains.
	- Magical Patron - The spirit of the river Scamander, the god Scamander, who sided with Troy during the war.
