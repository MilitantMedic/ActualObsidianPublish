The Rhine Tribunal covers the Holy Roman Empire primarily, that means it mostly covers Germany, Austria, and parts of Denmark (everything north of that is unclaimed land). It is the oldest Tribunal, and home to the Domus Magnae (House capitols) of House Bonisagus (Durenmar), Merinita (Irencillia), and Bjornaer (Crintera).

## Why would I want to play in the Rhine?

- You want to play in the oldest, and most typical Magi experience, albeit with a strong traditionalist upper class of Magi above you, at the center and birthplace of Hermetic culture.
- You want to play with a heavily formalized society, and either work with it, or try to reform it, with a number of well established but questionable Hermetic rulings with far reaching consequences. 
- You want to deal with the dichotomy of hiding in vast wild forests, and/or trying to live with or near mundanes.
- You want your mundane world to be somewhat united, but for the most part a number of disparate powers.
- You want your location to be central not just culturally, but physically in the Hermetic world, and be at a crossroads of Hermetic culture.
## Vis Level
Low - Medium

The Rhine is home to ancient and untouched forests, and Vis in there is not too difficult to find. The Dominion has yet to pressure too far into these woods, though small hamlets are common. A number of prized locations are already in the possession of another covenant, but one may be able to find a slice of the ancient land.

However the abundance of Vis in more populated areas is very low. Mundane encroachment, such as it is, is noticeably reducing the amount of Vis there is to be used.

The land of what is today Germany is filled with massive forests. Forests that are magical, mystical, and alive. All forests have a great spirit that represents them, and can, with some great effort, be communicated with. Though civilization is expanding, the wild is enormous, and there are plenty of places a Magi (or many others) can disappear to if they wish.

There are numerous woodland faeries hidden in the woods, along with various Seasonal courts of Fae to bargain with. The remnants of the tales of Siegfried, the dragons he fought, and his treasure are somewhere out there, and some woods contain much darker things.
## State of Hermetic Politics
Being the first Tribunal, the Rhine is one of the most conservative Tribunals. They are intensely resistant to change for the most part. There are very few Guernicus Magi in the tribunal, and the Peripheral Code is stiff. There are forces hoping to cause progress though. 

There are six political Gilds that the vast majority of Magi in the Tribunal associate with, each representing a different political viewpoint. A Magus is not required to be in a Gild, but it is generally expected.
- Oak Gild - To restore the glory of the Rhine Tribunal, respect the wisdom of the Founders, and encourage listening to one’s elders. Despite all of this, they don’t have much of a strategy beyond resisting change.
- Hawthorn Gild - To protect wild places and creatures from mundanes, and punish those that intrude.
- Ash Gild - For Magi to seek dominion over their lands, be forthright in their dealing with mundanes, fight the Order of Odin (a questionably real order of wizards from Scandinavia), and not have to hide in the wilderness.
- Elder Gild - Similar to the Hawthorn Gild, except with a focus on Magi wanting to foster positive relationships with Faeries, and to protect them from mundanes.
- Linden Gild - A gild promoting cooperation between Magi. Politically not that strong, but generally acts as an intermediary.
- Apple Gild - Believes that Magi should seek positive relations with mundanes, and seek to be more deeply intertwined in mundane affairs.

There is a significant divide between those that wish to retreat to the wilderness, and those that want to stay near the cities.![[Rhine map.png]]
## State of Mundane Politics
While the Holy Roman Empire isn’t peaceful, just this year (1220) it newly crowned Holy Roman Emperor Frederick the 2nd (though he has been king since 1212). Despite this, he makes his home in the land of his mother, Sicily. He is meant to be funding and preparing a crusade on orders of the Pope, and he has acquired a court astronomer, some say wizard, in Michael Scot.
## New Covenant Requirements
A new Covenant needs express permission from every other Covenant in the Tribunal, and they can only ask each Covenant once every seven years. This is less intense than it sounds, as no one wants to be the one Covenant to deny the new guys, and they’d prefer to ask for small demands in return for future favors. 

Once formed though, all Covenants generally give a small gift to the new one. 
## Hermetic Culture
- There are very generous rules of hospitality in the Rhine. There is a tradition of lone wandering Magi called Peregrinatores, and most Covenants are expected to have guest laboratories.
- While most Tribunals have a vague sense of who is a Master (or Magister) and who is an Archmage, the Rhine makes it official. There are strict delineations between Apprentices, Journeymen, Magisters, and Archmasters. Each role has natural political superiority over the others.
- Magi that pass into twilight are not referred to as though they have passed: they are simply otherwise occupied. Their votes are used in proxy by Masters and Archmagi.
- A ruling that many Quaesitors do not agree with is the Guardians of the Forest ruling. Essentially, Magi may defend the forests from mundane encroachment by almost any means necessary. How this interacts with interfering with mundanes has never fully been clarified.
- There is a massive split in politics in House Bjornaer, reflecting the split between those retreating to the wild and their aggressive desire to fight mundanes, and those that wish to more safely integrate to maintain the wild.
- There is a movement in the west of the Tribunal to split off from the Rhine and join some Normandy Covenants to form a new Tribunal to escape from restrictive Rhine practices. It isn’t public yet, but it may come out soon.
## Local Flavour & Trivia
- Soon, the legendary knight and minstrel Tannhäuser will start his journey and legend.
- In the 6th century, the Germanic area (along with parts of France) was ruled over by a group of Sorcerer Kings called the Merovingians. Their long hair, as long as it was never cut, gave them the abilities to be invincible in battle, heal through laying on hands, make crops grow by walking across fields, divinitory powers, and could understand the calls of beasts. The dynasty fell apart when two sons of the dynasty split the kingdom. The last of the dynasty died off or faded into irrelevance in the 8th century.
- The Nibelungenlied is a famous story in the Rhine, and was brought to the land in the 5th century, about the great knight Siegfried.
- There is a heresy called The Brethren of the Free Spirit. They believe in a pantheistic version of Christianity, and believe themselves to be heralding a new age. If everything is God, everything is good, thus there is no thing as sin. Thus they can do as they please.
- The Wild Hunt appears on stormy winter nights to terrorize the peasantry, and hunt vegetation spirits called Holzfrau in order to perpetuate winter. They may drag unfortunate mortals into their number.
- The forests naturally have great spirits and intelligences that are fae or magical (or infernal, or perhaps even divine). These forests can initiate those who take their trials into mystical traits and powers, if the petitioner can handle their initiations. 
- Durenmar hangs onto a few magical orbs created by the founder Verditius called the Magus Stones. They produce a magic aura of 3 that is mobile, and are truly wonders. He would have created more, but he thought they were uninteresting and not worth reproducing. Anyone would surely be able to reproduce them (They could not).
- There is a major rivalry between Fengheld and Durenmar for being the strongest Covenant in the tribunal, Durenmar through age, and Fengheld by being enormous, both physically and in terms of population.
- There is a heresy in the Bohemian Forest that believes in a dualistic faith worshiping the God of Truth that created the Cosmos, and deriding the God of Law that created the material world. They believe the Church follows the latter.
- North of the town of Trier, there is an ancient Roman amphitheater. It is said that upon blowing a specific magical horn at night, the ghosts of 3 ancient gladiators appear, and challenge all those there. The challenger must wager some trinket, but it is unknown what the gladiators wager. No one has yet won.
## Character and Covenant Ideas
### Magi
- The Rhine is the seat of house Bonisagus, and the head of the Tribunal is always the head of house Bonisagus. Research is heavily encouraged to be conservative. Breaking free of those confines to incorporate foreign magic is frowned upon. Durenmar, the Domus Magna of House Bonisagus, also contains one of the most massive libraries in the order. It isn’t very easy to get access, but as a Bonisagus you’d have an easier chance. Who knows what could be found in those books.
- House Guernicus barely has a presence in the Tribunal, and the House is not fond of its entrenched politics and rulings with (what they call) unfortunate implications. If you wish to try to “repair” the law, this may be the choice for you.
- House Tremere’s base of power is next door, and they try to influence the Tribunal. They are heavily encouraged to achieve the rank of Master, so they may train apprentices without stigma, taking an apprentice as a Journeyman is looked down upon.
- There a schism in House Bjornaer between the Wilderists, who wish to violently maintain the wild from mundane excursions, and the Harmonists, who want to find a way to maintain the wild by encouraging mundanes to live in harmony with it, as encroachment is inevitable. Any Bjornaer Magi would have to pick a side.
- The Domus Magna of House Merinita is also within the Rhine, along with supposedly the ancient former Domus Magna when Merinita was still a Diana Nature Cult. However the location of the original Domus Magna is unknown.
- House Jerbiton members are usually part of the Apple Gild, and have co-opted a Covenant originally created to spy on the Order of Odin, but instead started trading and created friendly relations with the Norwegians. They likely would encourage more relationships with the Free Cities of the Holy Roman Empire.
- House ex Misc Traditions common in the Area
	- Beast Masters
	- Tempestria (Weather Witches)
	- Donatores Requietis Aeternae
	- Pharmacopoeians
	- Rustic Magi
### Companion Characters
- There are a couple Holy Knightly Orders in the area, the most famous being the Knights Templar, and the locally marauding Knights of the Sword in the North East.
- Any characters related to the vast woodlands and their vast bounty would likely be useful as a whole.
- There are numerous Free Cities in Germany, and a number of freemen in them.
- There are very many individual Lords. Banditry, and its legal counterpart, toll taking is also very common.
- Werewolves are highly common in Pomerania, and those that are born into werewolf families are Skinchangers. Those born to human families have far less control. 
### Example Covenant Sites
- In Lower Lorraine, there are a few possible sites around the Vosges mountains. Setting up here would likely wrap the Covenant up in the plot to split off and create a new Tribunal.
- The Black Forest is far away from mundane involvement, but there are quite a few higher fantasy options, albeit in competition with the Domus Magna of House Bonisagus, Durenmar, and its split-off “Rival” Dankmar.
- The Eastern reaches, bordering the Transylvanian tribunal, would be ripe for conflict, or cooperation, with House Tremere.
- While not officially part of the Tribunal, Denmark, and Scandinavia as a whole, is ripe for expansion, and could be encouraged at the next Tribunal meeting to be included in the greater Tribunal.
- The Setup adventure has 4 sites possible in the cursed Rhine Gorge. Every Covenant created here has eventually been destroyed, and there was a Tribunal mandate for 20 years that no new Covenants could be started here. That’s about to lift, and one of those old sites could be made useful.
